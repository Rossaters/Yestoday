# Episode Description: 单集介绍

Seth Klarman is a legendary value investor and CEO and Portfolio Manager of The Baupost Group, an investment firm founded in 1982 that manages $27 billion. Seth authored the very out-of-print Margin of Safety and edited the recently released 7th edition of Graham and Dodd’s value investing classic, Security Analysis.

塞思·卡拉曼（Seth Klarman）是一位传奇的价值投资者，也是 Baupost 集团的首席执行官兼投资组合经理。Baupost 集团成立于 1982 年，是一家管理着 270 亿美元资产的投资公司。塞思撰写了《安全边际》（Margin of Safety）一书，该书已绝版，他还编辑了最近出版的格雷厄姆和多德的价值投资经典著作《证券分析》（Security Analysis）第 7 版。

Our conversation covers Seth’s early experience in business and investing, path to Baupost, timeless value investing principles and those that have changed over time. We discuss Baupost’s application of value investing across sourcing, diligence, portfolio construction, and risk management. We then turn to Seth’s thoughts illiquidity, international investing, the weird current environment, positioning portfolios for it, alignment with clients, succession at Baupost, and his updated perspectives on Securities Analysis and Margin of Safety. We close discussing Seth’s personal investments in the Boston Red Sox, horse racing, and philanthropy.

我们的谈话涉及塞思早期的商业和投资经历、通往 Baupost 的道路、永恒的价值投资原则以及随着时间推移而改变的原则。我们讨论了 Baupost 在采购、勤勉、投资组合构建和风险管理方面对价值投资的应用。接着，我们讨论了赛斯对流动性不足、国际投资、当前诡异的环境、投资组合的仓位管理、与客户保持一致、Baupost 的继任者以及他对证券分析和安全边际的最新看法。最后，我们讨论了塞思在波士顿红袜队、赛马和慈善事业方面的个人投资。

Seth generally stays away from the public eye, so I was particularly grateful to share this conversation some twenty-five years after we first met.

塞思一般不公开露面，所以在我们初次见面二十五年后，我特别感激能与他分享这次谈话。

# Early experience in business and investing 早期的商业和投资经验

**Ted Seides:** Seth, thanks so much for joining me.

**泰德·西德斯**：塞思，非常感谢你能来参加我的节目。

**Seth Klarman:** It's great to be with you. Thanks so much for having me.

**塞思·卡拉曼**：很高兴来参加节目，非常感谢你邀请我。

**Ted Seides:** I'd love to go all the way back to your first memories of your interest in business and investing.

**泰德·西德斯**：我想先请你谈谈，你最初是如何对商业和投资产生兴趣的？

**Seth Klarman:** Well, it goes way back to childhood, maybe even early childhood, I was always starting small businesses. I was a micro entrepreneur in the sense of doing leaf raking and lawn mowing. I had a snow cone stand and got in trouble with the Baltimore health authorities when we added hot dogs. So that's no cone stand cuz we didn't have a license. And I was having little carnivals in our yard for kids and built the mini golf course in my yard, although my mom didn't really appreciate that. I had a tiny interest in collecting coins and used to buy and sell some coins by mails, a mini activity as well. So I was just doing a lot, mostly just getting my feet wet and learning a lot.

**塞思·卡拉曼**：这要追溯到童年，甚至幼年的时候。那时我总做些“小生意”，是个“微型创业家”，做过打扫落叶和修剪草坪的工作。我9岁时摆过一个甜筒摊位，但当我开始售卖热狗时，惹上了巴尔的摩卫生局，因为我们没有执照。我在院子里为孩子们举办小型嘉年华，还在院子里建了一个迷你高尔夫球场，不过我妈妈不太喜欢。我对收集硬币有一点小兴趣，曾通过邮寄买卖一些硬币，这也是门迷你生意。可见，为了摸索和学习，我做了很多事情。

My main interest was in the stock market. I was a numbers guy. I love the baseball statistics. I was always turning the Baltimore Sun Papers to the sports section. They would have every batter and every pitcher in the American League and all their stats and I was learning how to calculate those statistics as well.

但我主要的兴趣还是股票市场。我是个对数字很敏感的人，喜欢看棒球统计数据。我经常翻阅《巴尔的摩太阳报》的体育版，上面会刊登美国联盟中每个击球手、投手的数据，我也在学习如何计算这些数据。

And at some point, I noticed there were a whole bunch of numbers a few pages after the baseball statistics. And I asked my dad what those were and found out those were the stock exchange listings. And so it just began another journey of trying to connect my interest to figure out what was going on and what was that all about. I read a bunch about the market. I remember reading a book about how I made $1 million in the stock market. I remember reading how to buy stocks by Lewis Engel. So kind of up and down the spectrum of what was out there.

直到有一次，我留意到棒球版面的后面几页布满了一大堆数字，我问父亲那是什么，结果发现是证券交易所的股票名单。于是，我开启了另一段旅程，试图把我的兴趣与之联系起来，弄清市场到底在发生什么，股市是怎么一回事。我读了很多关于市场的资料。我记得我读过一本关于如何在股市中赚到100万美元的书，我还读了路易斯·恩格尔（Lewis Ingle）写的《如何购买股票》，可以说市面上有的读物我都翻翻。

**Ted Seides:** How old were you when you buy your first stock?

**泰德·西德斯**：你是几岁买的第一只股票？

**Seth Klarman:** I bought a share of Johnson & Johnson when I was around 10 years old with money I got from my birthday. A few days later, it split 3 for 1, which I didn't know had been announced. It must have been announced a little bit before that. So I own 3 shares of Johnson and Johnson. Why did I buy it? I knew what the company did, and you gotta start somewhere. My mom found me a very kind stockbroker named Max Silverman down in Baltimore, and he was happy to execute an order where he couldn't possibly make any money. And he was my stockbroker for a number of years, but it was always at a very small scale.

**塞思·卡拉曼**：10岁左右时，我用生日攒的零花钱买了一股强生公司的股票。几天后，强生公司一拆三，这一消息想必在我买之前就已经宣布了，但我并不知情，所以我拥有了三股强生公司的股票。我为什么买强生的股票呢？原因在于我了解这家公司是做啥的，你总得从自己知道的领域开始吧。我妈妈在巴尔的摩给我找了个非常好的股票经纪人，叫麦克斯·西尔弗曼，他很乐意接一笔自己压根儿不赚钱的订单。他做了我好几年的股票经纪人，但交易规模一直很小。

**Ted Seides:** Where did that take you as you got older, you know, went through college?

**泰德·西德斯**：随着你年纪增长和在大学的学习，后来的人生轨迹是怎样的？

**Seth Klarman:** So I was really fortunate.

**塞思·卡拉曼**：我真的很幸运。

My Uncle Paul, my mother's brother, lived in New York, and he was a tax attorney and an old friend of Max Heine, who was the founder/head of Mutual Shares. My uncle introduced me to Max when I was junior in college and I got a job for the summer and then ultimately an offer to come back full time when I graduated, which was in January of 79. So that's how I got to mutual shares in my history there.

我舅舅保罗住在纽约，是一名税务律师，也是麦克斯·海因（Max Heine）的老朋友，麦克斯·海因是Mutual Shares的创始人。大三时，舅舅把我引荐给了麦克斯，那年暑假我开始在Mutual Share实习，并在79年1月毕业后获得了全职工作的机会。这就是我与Mutual Shares的渊源。

I continued to hold stocks, trade stocks and read, but the key was getting that job. It was a value investing mutual fund, Mike Price had started by then and was Max's protege and running a lot of the activities day to day. It was like being led in on a secret that you could read about it all you want, but when you actually start doing analysis and you see individual companies trade at a discount from what they're pretty obviously worse. It's easy to get excited that there's some inefficiency here, and you have a chance to really add value and do well.

此后，我继续持有股票、交易股票并且勤读不辍，但关键还是得到了那份工作。迈克尔·普莱斯（Mike Price）当时启动了一只价值投资共同基金，他是麦克斯的门徒，已经做得有起色了，每天管理着许多日常事务。（Michael Price于1976年成为Mutual Fund基金经理，当时基金管理资产只有500万美元，至1996年为止，他所管理的4只基金资产达130亿美元，20年成长了2600倍，基金在20年间平均年达20%，比同时期S&P500指数高出5个百分点）这就好似被告知了一个秘密，你可以随心所欲地去了解它。但当你真正着手分析时，当你看到个别公司的交易价明显低于其实际价值时，你很容易就为市场存在一些低效而感到兴奋。你有机会真正提供价值并且做得不错。

**Ted Seides:** What was your first 'Aha' moment from having picked a bunch of stocks yourself to now working and seeing a philosophy behind it?

**泰德·西德斯**：从自己挑选一堆股票，到后来工作并看到了其背后的理念，你的第一个顿悟时刻是什么？

**Seth Klarman:** The most clear thing was that picking stocks yourself, you knew what the companies did. I knew that Johnson & Johnson made bandages, which I apparently was an extensive user of when I was a small kid.

**塞思·卡拉曼**：最明确的一点是，你要自己挑选股票，并且你要知道那些公司都在做什么。我知道强生公司生产创可贴，当我少不更事时，我显然是其重度用户。

But I didn't really know how to connect that to anything tangible about why would I pay a particular price or what would make that stock go up or down. So being in the business and watching every day and seeing some of the peripheral things, like you can't just assume that just because the stock trades at a price or a bond trades at a price that you can actually buy any there, because it's a market, and maybe you can buy it and maybe it's not that liquid or maybe by the time you get around to deciding what you wanna buy, it's moved a lot. So there were just a lot of nuts and bolts that all went into the entire equation.

但我真不知道该如何将任何有形的东西与股价联系起来，比如我为什么要支付特定的价格？或者是什么因素让那只股票涨或跌？因此，进入这个行业后，我每天都在观察，留意到一些次要的东西，比如你不能仅仅因为股票以这个价格交易或债券以这个价格交易，就认为你可以在那买到任何股票。因为这是一个市场，也许你买得到，也许它流动性不是那么好，或是当你决定要买什么的时候，它的价格已经变了很多。因此，有很多细节会影响到整个等式。

Mutual Shares was a great place to sit because Max Heine had in his office this old railroad bond trader, Hans Jacobson. You hear all these names that they're bidding various prices, and you really have no idea what lies behind that. But eventually, it became clear that a number of them were US railroad bankruptcies, several connected to the Penn Central bankruptcy, which was unfolding around that time and which led to the creation of a bunch of other securities. It turns out, of course, that railroads had been granted building rights over the tracks and that they had all kinds of real estate value in addition to any value they might have as a railroad. And so there were just a series of securities that went from obscurity, because you'd never even heard of them, into mainstream, at least for somebody sitting at Mutual Shares, because they started to make sense and you understood why the price is fluctuated and why they might be really attractive as an investment.

光是坐在Mutual Shares就很好，因为麦克斯·海因的办公室里有一位老铁路债券交易员汉斯·雅各布森（Hans Jacobsen），你会听到各种公司名，它们以不同的价格进行交易，当时你真不知道这背后隐藏着什么。但最终，情况愈发明显，其中一些是美国铁路公司的破产案，有几起与宾夕法尼亚州中央铁路公司的破产案有关，该案当时正在进行中，并导致了一系列其他证券的诞生。事实证明，铁路公司已经获得了轨道上的建筑权，并且除了铁路本身可能具有的价值外，它们还拥有各种房地产价值。就这样，一系列证券从闻所未闻变为了主流（至少对Mutual Shares来说如此），因为现在它们开始变得合理，你明白了价格为什么会波动，以及为什么它们作为投资标的可能非常有吸引力。

I also remember the first stock, I believe Michael Price threw a prospectus on my desk and said, "Here, figure this out", which was a typical Michael Price instruction to me.

我也记得分析第一只股票的时候。当时迈克尔·普莱斯把一份招股说明书扔到我桌子上，说 “来，把这个搞清楚。”这是迈克尔·普莱斯给我下的惯用指示。

A company called Telecore, which was an electronics distributor, was losing their contract with the Japanese company whose products they were distributing, and they were gonna get bought out for the value of net working capital or something like that.

这家公司叫Telecore，是家电子产品分销商，当时正丢掉和一家日本公司的合同，而Telecore分销的正是这家日本公司的产品。Telecore打算以净营运资本的价值或类似的价格被收购。

Telecore also owned a subsidiary called Electro Rent, which rented and leased the same kind of electronic equipment. So you were gonna get $8 or so in cash over a period of time, but not that long. And you were going to receive share of Electro Rent, a fraction of a share of Electro Rent. And Electro Rent that valuation that you could created for was trading at under 1 times earnings.

Telecore还拥有一家名为“Electro Rent”的子公司，专门出租同类电子设备。在Telecore被收购的过程中，其股东将在一定时间内（时间不会太久）获得8美元左右的现金，还会获得Electro Rent一定比例的股票。而以这种方式所获得的Electro Rent股票，其隐含估值连1倍市盈率都不到。

And that was math I could do in my head and math that made the nature of that inefficiency seemed so glaring and so obvious, and probably was a great example for me of complexity can be an investor's friend, that if a person wanted to buy Electro Rent previously, they couldn't. The only way to get it was this way. That most of the time you wouldn't wanna pay \$8 in change to create a share of something that is only worth cents, in that most of the money you were just gonna get back from the liquidation payment end of the licensing deal with Telecore.

这是我在脑子里就能进行的数学运算，它让市场的低效显得如此耀眼和明显。对我来说，这是个很好的例子，说明复杂性可以成为投资者的朋友。如果一个人之前想买Electro Rent，他们是买不到的。唯一的办法就是以这种方式买。多数情况下，你不会想为了一个每股值几角钱的子公司而花8块钱买下整个公司，你之所以这样做是因为你能从Telecore合同结束后的清算付款中拿回大部分本金。

Nevertheless, it was a great lesson that there are arbitrage opportunities, that the complexity leads sometimes to opportunity that you need to really soak yourself in the details. That opportunity may not immediately be apparent. It certainly wouldn't be apparent from reading a financial report from last year cuz that's not an ongoing concern, but rather understanding how the pieces all come together using your own ideational thinking to understand what might get in the way. Is there an approval needed or are some payments owed to somebody that you've got to subtract before you think about your proceeds, or are there taxes due on the transaction? It was really a broadening example of the kind of things an arbitrage investor needs to think about, compare to an investor in a going concern.

这是很好的一课，即市场存在套利机会，复杂性有时会带来投资机会。你需要真正沉下心去关注各种细节，隐藏的机会才会显现出来，（在Telecore的案例中），光读公司去年的财报当然看不出机会，因为这已经不是一个可以持续经营下去的公司了。相反，你需要主动构思，了解各种碎片化信息是如何组合在一起的，从而明白哪些因素可能成为交易的阻碍。是否需要某种审批？是否有某些欠款，需要在计算收益前扣除？又或者公司是否需要为这笔交易缴纳税款？这确实是个拓宽眼界的案例，与持续经营企业的投资者相比，套利投资者需要考虑的事情更加纷繁复杂。

**Ted Seides:** So as you're learning early on in your career, it's also around the same time you had the Bill Sharps of the world writing about efficient markets hypothesis. And I'm really curious as you started hearing about that, thinking about the markets and index fund investing and then on the other side, you're seeing all these security level inefficiencies. How did you think about the investing world more broadly?

**泰德·西德斯**：在你早期的职业生涯学习阶段，正好也是比尔·夏普那些人撰写有效市场假说等理论的时期。我很好奇当你开始听到这些说法，思考市场和指数基金投资，同时又看到大量股票低于公允价值，显示市场似乎是低效的时候，你是如何更广泛地理解投资世界的？

**Seth Klarman:** I read a book after that, but quite a while ago called "To Conquer the Air". And it's about Orville and Wilbur. Right? And they're building a flying machine in the early 1900s. At the same time as they were trying to build an airplane, you had a guy named Langley at Smithsonian also trying to build a flying machine. And he was the respected guy. He was a academic and famous and everybody thought he would succeed. And it all made sense in theory. But the Wright brothers went down to Kitty Hawk, where the winds were strong and where they could experiment with what the winds might do to any particular kind of flying craft and how the wings of a airplane might be the same or different from the wings of a bird and how you might maneuver in the air. Langley's machine eventually was launched, I believe, off of a river, and it was all set to launch out over the water and fly. Accepted plopped in the water, never to be seen again. And the Wright brothers over a couple of summers, figured it out. 

**塞思·卡拉曼**：此后我读了一本书，那是很久以前的事了，书名叫《征服天空》，讲的是莱特兄弟在20世纪初制造飞行器的故事。在他们尝试建造飞机的同时，史密森公司有一个叫兰利的人也在尝试制造飞行器。他是个受人尊敬的学者，名气很大，每个人都认为他会成功，从理论上讲，一切合情合理。但莱特兄弟去了风力强劲的基蒂霍克，在那里他们可以试验风力对特定类型的飞行器的影响，以及飞机的机翼和鸟的翅膀之间有什么不同。相比之下，兰利的飞行器在一条河上发射，一切都为了从水面上发射和飞行而设置，但它最终却掉进水里，再也见不到了。几个夏天之后，莱特兄弟发明了飞机。

And I say that because it seems to me it's the same thing that I always thought. There are these academics, sitting in their institutions, writing out theories, and in theory, it makes sense. I might be Yogi Berra who said, in theory, every theory works, but in practice, a lot of them don't.

我这么说是因为在我看来这是一码事。我总觉得有些学者坐在自己的机构里写理论，从理论上讲，很多事情都有道理。约吉·贝拉（Yogi Berra，前美国职棒大联盟的捕手、教练与球队经理）好像说过，“理论上，每一个理论都是可行的。”但在实践中，很多理论并不可行。

The academic idea was logical that there are transaction costs and there are a lot of competitors. And even when there aren't that many, even one competitor can reprice and miss pricing. But had they chosen instead to sit down at the trading desk of Mutual Shares, they might have seen what really inefficient markets look like and realized that what's true in theory isn't true in practice in every case.

学术界的想法合乎逻辑，即（市场）存在交易成本，有很多参与者（competitors），即使没那么多参与者，一个交易对手也能重新定价。但要是他们坐在Mutual Shares的交易台前，他们可能就会看到真正低效的市场长什么样，然后意识到，**理论上正确的东西，在实践中并不总是对的。**

The first book that I read about the efficient market, it was Malcol, and it was about the random walk on Wall Street. I appreciated what he was trying to say, but I also knew that was just silliness. And what's interesting is it was true in the same way that they mused in that book. You could try to imagine what it would be like to ride a horse by sitting on the fence and observing a bunch of horses in the field. Or you can go get on a horse. I think it's as simple as that. You need to be creative. You need to be curious, need to be not afraid to fail, willing to think outside the box, and maybe you'll come up with something.

我读到的第一本关于有效市场的书是马尔科姆的《华尔街漫步》。我很欣赏他想表达的意思，但我也知道那玩意儿是愚蠢的。有意思的是，就像那本书中说的，你可以坐在围栏上观察场里的马，试着想象骑马的感觉，或者你也可以上马骑骑看。我觉得就是这么简单。你需要有创造力，你需要有好奇心，你需要不怕失败，愿意跳出条条框框去思考，这样你也许就会有所发现。

**Ted Seides:** As you're learning at Mutual Shares back in the day, how did you make the decision to go to business school?

**泰德·西德斯**：当你在Mutual shares学习时，是如何做出了去商学院进修的决定？

**Seth Klarman:** It was actually really tough. I enjoyed Mutual Shares immensely. I loved sitting side by side. I was literally next to Mike Price and right around the corner of the trading desk for Max Heine. And I was the only analyst. It was literally the three of us met a bunch of traders, and met people. It was such a wonderful learning experience, and I was soaking it in.

**塞思·卡拉曼**：事实上，这真的很难。我非常喜欢Mutual Share，我就坐在迈克普莱斯（Mike Price）旁边，就在麦克斯·海因（Max Heine）交易台的拐角处。我是唯一的分析师，就只有我们三个人和一群交易员和行政人员。这是一次美妙的学习经历，我沉浸其中。

On the other hand, I had a sense that top business school would be a good place to go. It would round me out. I may have known more and more about stocks, but I didn't know a lot about business. And so to study business to try to understand what's a good company, what makes a company great, how to think about running a company. And besides, the challenges was certainly appealing. And I ultimately thought it's not gonna be negative, it's probably gonna have a lot of positive. And it will make me better investor if I decide to stick to investing. I also wanted to rule out that there was something else I'd rather do, although I kind of suspected that investing was my thing. So I did investing before, took a summer job at Salomon Brothers just to see what investment banking was. It was very popular back then, and a lot of people were going in that direction. And I didn't think I'd love it, but I figured I'd try it and actually had a great experience and I enjoyed the young people at Solomon Brothers and met some of the partners who stayed in touch over the years, but I realized that investing was where my heart was. So as soon as I graduated, I had an offer to go back to Mutual Shares. But serendipitously had an opportunity to come in at the ground floor of Baupost being formed, and that's what I chose.

但另一方面，我有一种感觉，即顶级商学院会是一个好去处，它能让我变得更全面。我对股票的了解或许越来越多，但对商业却知之甚少。因此，学习商业，试图了解什么是好公司，是什么造就了一家伟大的公司，如何思考和应对公司经营中的挑战，这些无疑都很吸引我。归根结底，**我认为这一决定不会有什么负面影响，大概率会有很多积极作用**。如果毕业后我仍然决定坚守投资领域，它将使我成为更好的投资者。另外，虽然我感觉投资就是我的兴趣所在，但也想排除万一还有更愿意做的其他事。所以，此前我做过投资，我又在所罗门兄弟公司（Solomon Brothers）找了份暑期工，只是想看看投资银行到底是干啥的。那时候投资银行很流行，很多人都想往那个方向发展，我不觉得我会喜欢，但我还是想试试看，结果体验很不错。我很喜欢所罗门公司的年轻人，也结识了一些至今仍有联系的合伙人，但我意识到投资才是我心之所向。因此，我一毕业，就收到了回Mutual Shares工作的邀约，但偶然的机会让我来到了正在成立的Baupost公司。这就是我的选择。
