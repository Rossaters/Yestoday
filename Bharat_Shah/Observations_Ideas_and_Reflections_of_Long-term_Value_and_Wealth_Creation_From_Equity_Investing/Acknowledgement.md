# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

前言

Quest for value and wealth creation, through investing, is an eternal one. This search, unlike Physics, is not entirely intuitive or contemplative. Pure Physics (or theoretical one), unlike applied Physics, is very abstract and conceptual. Empirical evidence, usually, comes much later. Take, for example, Higgs Boson or Theory of Relativity. Theory was formulated, in each case, much before it was possible to validate the theory with an observation or an experiment. Fortunately, good investing does not call for such high skills. Also,a body of recorded evidence and a set of observations heip in formulating many investment principles unlike the other way round. Some level of intuitive skills is also called for in investing which makes it a blend of art and science.

通过投资寻求价值和财富创造是永恒的。与物理学不同，这种探索并非完全凭直觉或深思熟虑。纯粹的物理学（或理论物理学），与应用物理学不同，是非常抽象和概念性的。实证检验证据通常要晚些时候才会出现，比如希格斯玻色子或相对论理论。在每种情况下，理论都是在可以通过观察或实验来验证理论之前很久就已经形成的。幸运的是，良好的投资并不需要如此高超的技能。此外，记录在案的证据和一系列观察有助于制定许多投资原则，而不是反过来。投资也需要一定程度的直觉技能，这使得投资成为艺术和科学的结合体。

In the enclosed study, covering a period of a decade, an attempt has been made to cull out some investment principles. They have been sought to be affirmed from the observed data in the Indian context. The investment principles have always existed for quite some time. The study has largely focused on validation of the same. Ithas benefited from all the prior good work.

在这份为期十年的研究中，我们试图总结出一些投资原则。这些原则是从印度的观察数据中得出并加以确认的。这些投资原则已经存在了相当长时间，本研究主要集中在验证它们上面。该研究受益于之前所有优秀工作的成果。

The study efforts have spanned well over six months. It has been a tremendous team effort to make it happen. While many have helped, directly or indirectly, some individuals stand out. **Sudhir Kedia** and **Sumit Jain** have made enormous contribution with their outstanding data crunching efforts as well as by being, senerally speaking, critical sounding board, in crafting and shaping many thoughts. So much of data has been looked at and appropriately layered. None of that would have been possible without their invaluable efforts. **Raideep Singh** and **Darshit Sheth** have worked tirelessly at all the stages. Right from the stage of encapsulating of the thoughts, converting them into clean readable copies, formulating them and reformulating them, both Raideep and Darshit have played stellar role. They have been actually human machines! **Parth Trivedi** has also chipped in with a lot of support from time to time. Without any over-statement, this study would not have seen the light of day, without the support, heip, thoughts and perseverance of all of them. And there have been others who have generally encouraged, cheered and esged on to carry ahead, when the efforts started looking more like work and when often,it became over whelming!

研究工作已经持续了六个多月。为了实现这一目标，整个团队付出了巨大的努力。虽然有很多人直接或间接地帮助过，但一些人脱颖而出。Sudhir Kedia 和 Sumit Jain 在数据分析方面做出了巨大贡献，并且在塑造和形成许多想法时扮演着至关重要的角色。他们查看了如此之多的数据并适当地进行了层次化处理。没有他们宝贵的努力，这一切都不可能实现。Raideep Singh 和 Darshit Sheth 在每个阶段都不知疲倦地工作着。从概括思想、将其转化为干净易读的副本、制定和重新制定思路等方面，Raideep 和 Darshit 发挥了杰出作用。他们实际上就像机器一样！Parth Trivedi 也时常提供支持。毫无夸张地说，如果没有所有人的支持、帮助、思考和坚韧不拔精神，这项研究将无法问世。还有其他人总是鼓舞我们前进，在工作开始变得更像工作以及经常变得压倒性时给予我们支持！

Hope you enjoy it as much as it was a joy in creating it.

希望你能像我们创作它时一样享受它。

「生命的乐趣在于发挥自己的能量，不断成长、持续变化，享受每一种新体验。停止意味着死亡。人类最大的错误是建立一个可以实现的理想。」
