December 26, 1969

To My Partners:

致我的合伙人：

Our plans regarding the initial cash distribution have been finalized and we expect to mail to you on January 3rd a check dated January 5th, 1970 for approximately 64% of your January 1st, 1969 capital, less any distributions made to you (including monthly payments) since January 1st, 1969. If you have taken no monthly payments during 1969, there will be a small interest adjustment in your favor; if you have had loans from BPL, there will be an interest charge. I couldn't be more delighted about the action of the bond and stock markets from the standpoint of the timing of our liquidation. I believe practically all partners - whether they would have invested in bonds or stocks - will be far better off receiving the cash now than if we had liquidated at the end of last year. Those seeking income will receive about 40% more after tax on the same principal investment than they would have achieved only a year ago at what then seemed like generous yields.

我们关于首次现金分配的计划已经敲定，预计将于1970年1月3日向你邮寄一张日期为1970年1月5日的支票，金额约为1969年1月1日时你在合伙公司所拥有资产的64%，但要扣除1969年1月1日以来的你所有已收到的资金（包括“月度支付”）。如果你在1969年期间没有领取过“月度支付”，则会有一笔对你有利的小额利息调整；如果你从合伙公司借过贷款，则会有一笔利息费用。从我们清算的时机来看，我对债券市场和股票市场的走势再高兴不过了。我相信，几乎所有的合作伙伴，无论他们想投资债券还是股票，现在收到现金的时机都会比在去年年底清算要好得多。与一年前看似丰厚的收益率相比，那些寻求收益的人在相同本金投资上获得的税后收益将高出约 40%。

Our tax picture is virtually complete and it appears that you will have ordinary income (dividends plus interest income less ordinary loss) for Federal tax purposes of about 3-3/4% of your January 1st, 1969 capital (item 1 in enclosed letter), no significant long-term capital gain or loss, and a short-term capital loss of about 8-1/2% of your January 1st, 1969 unrealized appreciation (item 3). These estimates are just rough approximations - definitive figures will reach you in early February.

我们的纳税情况已基本完成。就联邦税而言，你的日常收入（股息加利息收入减去普通损失）约为1969年1月1日资本的3.75%（随附信中的第1项）；没有重大的长期资本损益；短期资本损失约为1969年1月1日账面浮盈的的8.5%（第3项）。这些估计只是粗略的近似值，确切的数字将在二月初寄给你。

The sale of our 371,400 shares of Blue Chip Stamps was not completed in 1969. When the stock went into registration, it was selling at about $24 per share. The underwriters indicated a range where they expected to offer our shares (along with others) with heavy weight placed on a comparison with Sperry & Hutchinson. Shortly before the stock was to be offered, with the Dow-Jones Industrials much lower but S & H virtually unchanged, they indicated a price below their former range. We reluctantly agreed and felt we had a deal but, on the next business day, they stated that our agreed price was not feasible. We then withdrew and a much smaller offering was done.

我们想要出售371,400股蓝筹印花的交易在1969年没有完成。股票注册时，售价约为每股24元。承销商指出了他们预计出售我们股票（以及其他股票）的价格范围，并着重强调了与Sperry & Hutchinson的比较。在股票发售前不久，道琼斯工业指数大幅下跌，但 S & H 公司的股价几乎没有变化，承销商提出的价格却低于他们之前的范围。我们勉为其难地同意了，并认为我们达成了交易，但在下一个工作日，他们表示我们商定的价格不可行。于是，我们撤回了报价，并完成了一次规模小得多的发售。

I intend to hold our block of Blue Chip Stamps in BPL for a more advantageous disposal or eventual distribution to our partners. The odds are decent that we will do better in this manner -even if it takes a year or two - than if we had participated in a very large sale into a somewhat distressed market. Unless there is a material change in the market in the next few days, I plan to value our Blue Chip holdings at yearend at the price received by selling shareholders on the public offering after underwriting discount and expenses.

我打算让合伙公司继续持有我们的蓝筹印花股票，以便进行更有利的处置或最终分配给我们的合伙人。与在股市低迷时参与大宗公开发售相比，我们这样做，即使需要一两年的时间，也可能会获得更大的收益。除非未来几天市场出现重大变化，否则我计划在年末对我们持有的蓝筹印花进行估值，价格为公开发行时的售价，扣除承销折扣和费用。

Various questions have been asked pursuant to the last letter:

根据上一封信的内容，大家提出了各种问题：

1\. If we are not getting a good return on the textile business of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., why do we continue to operate it?

1\. 如果伯克希尔哈撒韦公司的纺织业务不能给我们带来丰厚的回报，我们为什么还要继续经营呢？

Pretty much for the reasons outlined in my letter. I don't want to liquidate a business employing 1,100 people when the Management has worked hard to improve their relative industry position, with reasonable results, and as long as the business does not require substantial additional capital investment. I have no desire to trade severe human dislocations for a few percentage points additional return per annum. Obviously, if we faced material compulsory additional investment or sustained operating losses, the decision might have to be different, but I don't anticipate such alternatives.

差不多就是因为我在信中所述的原因。在管理层努力改善其行业地位并取得合理成果的情况下，只要业务不需要大量的额外资本投入，我就不想清算一家雇用1,100名员工的企业。我不想用严重的人员混乱，来换取每年几个点的额外利润。显然，如果我们面临大量且必须的新增投资或持续的经营亏损，我们的决定可能会有所不同，但我预计不会出现这种情况。

2\. How large is our investment in Sun Newspapers, etc., and do we intend to expand in the newspaper, radio and TV business?

2\. 我们在《太阳报》等公司的投资有多大，我们是否打算扩大报纸、广播和电视业务？

The combined investment in Sun, Blacker Printing and Gateway Underwriters is a little over $1 per share of Berkshire Hathaway, and earns something less than 10 cent per share. We have no particular plans to expand in the communication field.

伯克希尔哈撒韦对太阳报、Blacker印刷公司和Gateway承保公司的投资总计略高于每股1美元，每股收益不到10美分。我们没有扩大通信领域的特别计划。

3\. What does Gateway Underwriters do?

3\. Gateway承保公司是做什么的？

Gateway Underwriters serves primarily as a General Agent for National Indemnity Company in the State of Missouri.

Gateway承保公司主要担任国民保险公司在密苏里州的总代理。

4\. Are there good "second men" to take over from the men running the three excellent operating businesses?

4\. 那三项出色业务是否有好的“二把手”来接替经营呢？

In any company where the founder and chief driving force behind the enterprise is still active, it is very difficult to evaluate "second men". The only real way to see how someone is going to do when running a company is to let him run it. Some of our businesses have certainly been more "one-man shows" than the typical corporation. Subject to the foregoing caveat, I think that we do have some good “second men” coming along.

在任何一家企业中，如果企业的创始人和主要推动者仍然活跃，就很难对“二把手”进行评估。要想知道一个人在经营公司时会有怎样的表现，唯一真正的办法就是让他去经营。与典型的公司相比，我们的一些企业无疑更像是“独角戏”。在上述前提下，我认为我们确实有一些优秀的“二把手”正在崭露头角。

5\. In what area do you plan to invest the cash in Diversified Retailing Company and do you intend to stick primarily to the retailing field?

5\. 你们计划将多元零售的现金投资于哪个领域，是否打算主要坚持在零售领域？

While we prefer the retailing field, we do not preclude anything that will make sense. We have been looking without success for two years for an intelligent acquisition for DRC, so we are not about to rule out any industry, if the business looks good. Pending such time as we find one or more operating businesses to buy, the money will be invested in marketable securities.

虽然我们倾向于零售领域，但并不排除其他任何有意义的投资。两年来，我们一直在为多元零售寻找明智的收购机会，但一直没有成功。因此如果业务前景良好，我们不会排除任何行业。在我们找到一家或多家正在运营的企业进行收购之前，资金将投资于有价证券。

6\. Why didn't DRC payout the money it received on the sale of Hochschild, Kohn & Company?

6\. 为什么多元零售不把出售Hochschild, Kohn & Company所获得的资金分给股东？

In addition to the fact that such a payment would constitute a dividend, taxable in significant part as ordinary income, there are restrictions in the bond indenture which prevent such a pay-out without turning over control of the company to the bondholders.

一个原因是，这种支付会构成分红，在很大程度上应作为普通收入征税。另一个原因是，债券契约中还有一些限制条款，规定在不将公司控制权移交给债券持有人的情况下，不能进行这种支付。

7\. Will distribution of the DRC stock cause the DRC debentures to be called?

7\. 分配多元零售的股票是否会导致多元零售债权被赎回？

After distribution of the stock, I will be the largest stockholder in DRC and, hence, the call provision will not apply.

分配股票后，我将成为多元零售的最大股东，因此，赎回条款将不适用。

8\. How would we know if the DRC debentures were called?

8\. 我们如何知道多元零售的债券是否会被赎回？

All stockholders and debenture holders would find out directly from the company through regular or special reports that the company issues to its security holders. There is no intention at all of calling the debentures.

所有股票持有人和债券持有人都会通过公司向其证券持有人发布的定期报告或特别报告直接从公司得知相关信息。公司完全无意赎回债券。

9\. Why did you not register our Berkshire Hathaway and Diversified Retailing shares so that the stock, when received by the partners, would be freely marketable?

9\. 你们为什么不登记我们的伯克希尔哈撒韦和多元零售公司的股票，以便合伙人收到股票后可以自由出售？

We considered this possibility but rejected it for both practical and legal considerations. I will just discuss the practicalities, since they would independently dictate the decision we made.

我们考虑过这种可能性，但出于实际和法律两方面的考虑，就放弃了。下面我将只讨论实际问题，因为它足以决定我们做出的选择。

There is presently no existing market for Diversified Retailing, and our holdings of Berkshire Hathaway are probably four or five times the present floating supply of this stock. An attempt to quickly buy or sell a few thousand shares can easily move BH stock several points or more. We own 691,441 shares. Were we to distribute these stocks to you via a registration without an underwriting, and with the possibility that a substantial portion would be offered for sale by many sellers operating individually but virtually simultaneously, there is a real likelihood, particularly in a stock market environment such as we have seen recently, that the market for these two stocks would be little short of chaotic. It has not seemed to me that this was the kind of situation with which I should leave you, both from the standpoint of the price level which might prevail, as well as for the reason that different partners might well have to liquidate at widely varying price levels. The more sophisticated partners might have an important edge on the less sophisticated ones, and I believe many partners might have no chance to realize the prices I anticipate using for yearend valuation. This would rightly seem most unfair to you, since I would have received some allocation of 1969 BPL profits based upon these yearend valuations. If the markets were to become distressed, I would probably come in for criticism, whether I personally bought at lower prices or, perhaps more so, if I refrained from buying.

目前多元零售公司的股票还没有交易市场，而我们持有的伯克希尔哈撒韦公司的股票可能是该股票目前交易量的四五倍。迅速买卖几千股股票，就能轻易使伯克希尔的股价波动几个点或更多。我们拥有 691,441股。如果我们在没有承销商的情况下，通过注册的方式将这些股票分配给你们，许多人可能会同时出售很大一部分股票，这样的话，特别是在我们最近看到的这种股市环境下，这两只股票的市场很可能会混乱不堪。在我看来，无论是从可能出现的价格水平的角度来看，还是从不同的合伙人很可能必须在大相径庭的价格水平上进行清算的角度来看，这种情况都不是我应该留给你们的。经验丰富的合伙人可能比经验不足的合伙人更有优势，我认为很多合伙人可能根本没有机会得到我预计的年终估值价格。这对你们来说很不公平，因为根据这些年终估值，我本可以从1969年的合伙公司利润中获得一些分成[^1]。如果市场变得不景气，无论我个人是以较低的价格买进，还是因为受限而不能买进，都很可能会受到批评。

Were we to attempt to sponsor an underwriting in connection with a registration for those partners who might wish to sell, there would be, in my opinion, the likelihood that the result would still be far less than satisfactory. We have just been around this track with our holdings of Blue Chip Stamps, where we watched the price of our stock go from 24 to 16-1/2 after announcement of the underwriting, of which we originally were to be a part. I did not want this sort of result for the partners with respect to their holdings of Berkshire and Diversified.

在我看来，如果我们试图为那些可能希望出售的合伙人提供与注册有关的承销赞助，那么结果很可能还是远不尽如人意。我们刚刚在蓝筹印花公司的股票上就遇到过这种情况，在宣布承销之后，我们的股票价格从24美元跌到了16.5美元，而我们本来也是要参与承销的。我不希望合伙人持有的伯克希尔和多元零售公司的股票也出现这种结果。

It is my belief that, by confining sales to private placements, those partners who wish to sell will realize more for their stock (with the sophisticated partners having no marketing edge on the less knowledgeable) than would be achieved, through an underwriting at this time. Also, the stock should be more likely to find its way into the hands of long-term investment-minded holders, which should mean less volatile markets in the future. We have had several phone calls from persons indicating that they wish to make private sales - we anticipate there will be no difficulty in effectuating such sales at prices related to our yearend valuations.

我相信，通过私下的交易方式，那些希望出售股票的合伙人将比此时通过承销获得更多的收益（经验丰富的合伙人在营销方面不会比经验不足的合伙人更有优势）。此外，股票也更有可能落入具有长期投资意识的持有者手中，这意味着未来的市场波动会更小。我们已经接到一些人的电话，表示他们希望私下出售股票——我们预计，以我们年终估计的价格出售股票不会有任何困难。

Those partners who would prefer an underwritten distribution always have the option of having a registration of their own. I will be glad to facilitate this by placing all partners in touch with each other who indicate to me their desire to sell via a registered underwriting, at their expense and through an underwriter of their choice. In this way the expense of an underwriting, which can be considerable, would be borne by the selling partners and not by the partners as a whole.

那些希望采用承销方式的合作伙伴始终可以选择自己注册。我很乐意为他们提供便利，让所有向我表示希望通过注册承销销售的合伙人相互联系，费用由他们自己承担，并由他们选择承销商。这样一来，可能相当可观的承销费用，将由这些合伙人承担，而不是由全体合伙人承担。

I have also had partners ask if they could participate in a registered offering in the future if I should sell shares in this manner. I think it is almost certain I will never sell stock via public offering but, should it ever happen, I will be glad to let any of you participate in any underwritten offering in which I might be involved. In all probability, if it ever did happen, your stock would already be “free”, although mine would still be restricted. I cannot make the same commitment to you regarding any private sale I might make in the future, just as I can't expect you to restrict any sale options you might have in order to include me.

也有合伙人问我，如果我将来以这种方式出售股份，他们能否参与注册发行。我想我几乎可以肯定，我永远不会通过公开发行的方式出售股票，但是，如果真的发生了，我会很高兴让你们任何人参与我可能参与的任何承销发行。总之，如果真的发生了，你们的股票就“自由”了，尽管我的股票仍然是受限制的。对于我将来可能进行的任何私人销售，我不能向你们做出同样的承诺，就像我不能指望你们为了把我包括在内，而限制你们可能拥有的任何销售选择权一样。

10\. Will you let us know if you sell your holdings of BH or DRC?

10\. 如果你出售所持有的伯克希尔或多元零售公司股票，会让我们知道吗？

You would undoubtedly know from corporate communications, reports in the press and reports to Government agencies if I disposed of my holdings. I have no intention at all of doing so in the foreseeable future - I merely make no commitment not to. However, former BPL partners will have no priority over other BH or DRC security holders in obtaining information relating to their corporate activities.

如果我出售所持股份，你们无疑会从公司通讯、新闻报道和向政府机构提交的报告中得知。在可预见的将来，我完全无意这样做，我只是没有承诺不这样做。不过，巴菲特合伙公司的前合伙人在获取有关其公司活动的信息方面，不会比其他伯克希尔和多元零售公司股票持有人享有优先权。

11\. Should I hold my BH or DRC stock?

11\. 我应该持有伯克希尔或多元零售公司的股票吗？

I can’t give you the answer on this one. All I can say is that I’m going to do so and I plan to buy more. I am very happy to have a material portion of my net worth invested in these companies on a long term basis. Obviously, I think they will be worth significantly more money five or ten years hence. Compared to most stocks, I think there is a low risk of loss. I hope their price patterns follow a rather moderate range related to business results rather than behaving in a volatile manner related to speculative enthusiasm or depression. Obviously, I cannot control the latter phenomena, but there is no intent to "promote" the stocks as much of the distasteful general financial market activity of recent years.

我无法给你答案。我只能说，我打算这样做，而且我计划买更多的股票。我很高兴能将我净资产相当大的一部分长期投资于这些公司。显然，我认为五年或十年后，它们的价值将会大大提高。与大多数股票相比，我认为亏损的风险很低。我希望它们的价格波动在一个与经营业绩相关的相当温和的区间，而不是以一种与投机狂热或低沉相关的波动方式表现出来。显然，我无法控制后一种现象，但我无意“推动”这些股票，就像近年来许多令人反感的金融市场活动一样。

12\. Can I give either BH or DRC shares to my wife or children?

12\. 我可以将伯克希尔或多元零售公司的股票赠与妻子或子女吗？

We are advised by counsel that this is permissible but, of course the same restrictions on transfer that applied to you would apply to the donee of the gift.

律师告诉我们，这是允许的，当然，适用于你的转让限制同样适用于受赠人。

13\. Why are you waiting until March to give us your suggestions regarding bonds?

13\. 你为什么要等到三月份才给我们关于债券的建议？

January and February promise to be very busy months. Many partners may want to talk to me about their questions and objectives regarding bonds. I want to have all important BPL matters out of the way before I talk with any of them on an individual basis. I make no forecasts regarding the bond market (or stock market) - it may be higher or lower in March than now. After my October letter, several partners became very eager to buy bonds immediately - to date they are much better off by waiting. The excellent quality tax-free bonds I talked about at that time with yields of 6 -1/2% can now be bought to yield about 7%.

一月和二月将是非常繁忙的两个月。许多合作伙伴可能想和我谈谈他们在债券方面的问题和目标。我希望在与他们单独交谈之前，先把所有重要的巴菲特合伙公司事宜处理好。我不会对债券市场（或股票市场）做任何预测——3月份的债券价格可能比现在更高或更低。在我10月份的信之后，有几位合伙人急于立即购买债券——到目前为止，他们等待的结果要好得多。用我当时谈到的购买收益率为6.5%的优质免税债券的资金，现在可以买到收益率约为7%的同样的债券。

Cordially,  

Warren E. Buffett

[^]: 指按照巴菲特的年终估值，合伙人本来可以获得超过6%的收益率，巴菲特也可以获得6%之上收益的分成。言下之意是将伯克希尔和多元零售的股票登记以后，大量的买盘会让大部分合伙人卖亏了。
