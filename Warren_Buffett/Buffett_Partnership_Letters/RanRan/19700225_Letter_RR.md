February 25th, 1970

1970 年 2 月 25 日

To My Partners:

致各位合伙人：

This letter will attempt to provide a very elementary education regarding tax-exempt bonds with emphasis on the types and maturities of bonds which we expect to help partners in purchasing next month. If you expect to use our help in the purchase of bonds, it is important that you carefully read (and, if necessary , reread) this letter as it will serve as background for the specific purchases I suggest. If you disagree with me as to conclusions regarding types of bonds or maturities (and you would have been right and I would have been wrong if you had disagreed with me on the latter point either one or two years ago), you may well be correct, but we cannot be of assistance to you in the purchase of bonds outside our area. We will simply have our hands full concentrating in our recommended area, so will be unavailable to assist or advise in the purchase of convertible bonds, corporate bonds or short term issues.

在这封信中，我要讲一些关于免税债券的基础知识。我们下个月要帮合伙人购买债券，这里主要讲一下我们要购买的债券的类型和期限。如果你希望找我们帮忙买债券，请务必仔细读这封信，有不懂的地方，请多读几遍。因为有了这封信里的基础知识，你才能听明白我给出的具体购买建议。我在信中会讲到债券的类别和期限，如果你认为我说的不对，很可能你是对的。我们只能向你推荐我们觉得合适的，你和我们的看法不一样，我们就帮不上忙了。我们没办法帮各位购买可转债、公司债或短期债券，只是推荐我们选好的债券，对我们来说就已经是很大的工作量了。

I have tried to boil this letter down as much as possible. Some of it will be a little weighty - some a little over- simplified. I apologize for the shortcomings in advance. I have a feeling I am trying to put all the meat of a 100 page book in 10 pages - and have it read like the funny papers.

在这封信里，我尽量只挑重要的写。有的地方可能讲得多了一些，有些地方可能讲得太简单了。有写的不合适的地方，我先在这里请各位谅解。写这封信的时候，我感觉我要把一本100页的书中的精华浓缩到10页里，而且还要写的通俗易懂。

I am sure you understand that our aid in the purchase of bonds will involve no future assistance regarding either these specific bonds or general investment decisions. I want to be available at this time to be of help because of the unusual amount of cash you have received in one distribution from us. I have no desire to be in the investment counseling business, directly or indirectly, and will not be available for discussion of financial matters after March 31st.

我相信各位都很清楚，我们这次帮大家购买债券，但是我们将来不会再给大家提供关于这些债券或其他投资决策的帮助。这次我希望能帮到大家，是因为在进行了现金分配后，各位收到了一大笔资金。我不想再从事投资咨询工作了，无论是直接的，还是间接的。3月31日以后，本人概不接受任何理财问题。

# The mechanics of Tax-Free Bonds. 如何购买和保管免税债券

For those who wish our help, we will arrange the purchase of bonds directly from municipal bond dealers throughout the country and have them confirm sale of the bonds directly to you. The confirmation should be saved as a basic document for tax purposes. You should not send a check to the bond dealer since he will deliver the bonds to your bank, along with a draft which the bank will pay by charging your account with them. In the case of bonds purchased in the secondary market (issues already outstanding), this settlement date will usually be about a week after confirmation date whereas, on new issues, the settlement date may be as much as a month later. The settlement date is shown plainly on the confirmation ticket (in the case of new issues this will be the second and final ticket rather than the preliminary "when issued" ticket), and you should have the funds at your bank ready to pay for the bonds on the settlement date. If you presently own Treasury Bills, they can be sold on a couple of days notice by your bank upon your instructions, so you should experience no problems in having the money available on time. Interest begins to accrue to you on the settlement date, even if the bond dealer is late in getting them delivered to your bank.

对于希望我们提供帮助的合伙人，我们会安排通过业务范围遍布全国的市政债券交易商直接购买债券，并让它们确认将债券直接销售给合伙人。各位应当妥善保存确认书，作为税收申报材料。各位无需向债券交易商寄送支票，债券交易商会把债券直接交付到各位的银行名下，银行直接从你们的账户中扣除相应款项。对于在二级市场买入的债券（已流通品种），交收日一般是确认日的一周以后。对于新发行的品种，交收日最长可能是一个月以后。交收日期显示在确认单上（对于新发行的品种，确认单是第二张，也是最后一张凭单，不是最开始的那张“发行时”凭单）。你应当在银行中留足资金，为交收日支付债券款项做好准备。如果你目前持有国债，只要通知银行，一两天就能卖出去，所以你有足够的时间准备购买债券的资金。利息从交收日开始累计，即使债券交易商将债券交付给银行的日期晚于交收日也是如此。

Bonds will be delivered in negotiable form (so-called "bearer" form which makes them like currency) with coupons attached. Usually the bonds are in $5,000 denominations and frequently they can be exchanged for registered bonds (sometimes at considerable expense and sometimes free-it depends upon the terms). Bonds in registered form are nonnegotiable without assignment by you, since you are the registered owner on the Transfer Agent's books. Bonds trade almost exclusively on a bearer basis and it is virtually impossible to sell registered bonds without converting them back into bearer form. Thus, unless you are going to own great physical quantities of bonds. I recommend keeping bonds in bearer form. This means keeping them in a very safe place and clipping the coupons every six months. Such coupons, when clipped, can be deposited in your bank account just like checks. If you have $250,000 in bonds, this probably means about fifty separate pieces of paper ($5,000 denominations) and perhaps six or eight trips a year to the safe deposit section to cut and deposit coupons.

债券如同货币一样，采用无记名形式，可以转让。债券上附有息票。债券的面额一般为5,000美元一张，一般可以转换为记名债券（有的债券转换为记名债券需要支付一笔费用，有的可以免费转换，具体要看债券的条款）。就记名债券而言，你是注册代理人名册中的注册持有人，没你的签名，记名债券不可转让。债券基本上都是采用不记名的方式交易的。如果持有记名债券，不转换为不记名债券的话，很难卖出去。除非是你的实体债券太多，都管不过来，我建议你还是采用不记名的形式。这样的话，债券一定要存放在非常安全的地方，而且每六个月剪一次息票。息票剪下后可以像支票一样存在银行。如果你买了250,000美元的债券，大概就是50张（每张面值5,000美元），每年可能要打开保险柜六次或八次，将息票剪下并存到银行。

It is also possible to open a custody account with a bank where, for a fairly nominal cost, they will keep the bonds, collect the interest and preserve your records for you. For example, a bank will probably perform the custodial service for you for about $200 a year on a $250,000 portfolio. If you are interested in a custodial account, you should talk to a Trust Officer at your commercial bank as to the nature of their services and cost. Otherwise, you should have a safe deposit box.

你也可以在银行开一个委托保管账户，花不了多少钱，银行可以替你保管债券、收息并保留记录。以250,000美元的投资组合为例，在银行开设委托保管服务的费用是每年200美元左右。如果想开设委托保管账户，请联系附近商业银行的信托业务员，了解相关服务和费用。要是自己管理的话，应该放在保险箱里。

# Taxation 税项

The interest received upon the deposit of coupons from tax-free bonds is, of course, free from Federal Income Taxes. This means if you are at a 30% top Federal Income Tax bracket, a 6% return from tax-free bonds is equivalent to about 8-1/2% from taxable bonds. Thus, for most of our partners, excluding minors or some retired people, tax-free bonds will be more attractive than taxable bonds. For people with little or no income from wages or dividends, but with substantial capital, it is possible that a combination of taxable bonds (to bring taxable income up to about the 25% or 30% bracket) plus tax-free bonds will bring the highest total after-tax income. Where appropriate, we will work with you to achieve such a balance.

将免税债券的息票存在银行可获得利息收入，这部分利息当然不必缴纳联邦所得税。如果你的联邦所得税税档为30％，你从收益率为6％的免税债券所获得的收益，与收益率为8.5％的应税债券相当。除了未成年人和一些退休人员，对于我们的大部分合伙人来说，购买免税债券比购买应税债券合适多了。有的人有一大笔资金，但是没有工作收入或股息收入，他们可以做一个应税债券和免税债券的组合，可以获得最高的税后收益。如果你属于这种情况，我们会帮你构建一个这样的组合。

The situation in respect to State Income Taxes is more complicated. In Nebraska. where the State Income Tax is computed as a percentage of the Federal Income Tax, the effect is that there is no state tax on interest from tax- free bonds. My understanding of both the New York and California law is that tax-free bonds of entities within the home state are not subject to State Income Tax, but tax-free bonds from other states are subject to the local State Income Tax. I also believe that the New York City Income Tax exempts tax-free bonds of entities based within the State of New York, but taxes those from other states. I am no expert on state income taxes and make no attempt to post myself on changes taking place within the various states or cities. Therefore, I defer to your local tax advisor, but simply mention these few general impressions so that you will be alert to the existence of a potential problem. In Nebraska there is no need to have any local considerations enter into the after-tax calculation. Where out-of-state issues are subject to local taxation, the effective cost of your State or Municipal Income Tax is reduced by the benefit received from deducting it on your Federal Income Tax return. This, of course, varies with the individual. Additionally, in some states there are various taxes on intangible property which may apply to all tax-free bonds or just those of out-of-state entities. There are none of these in Nebraska, but I cannot advise on the other states.

至于各州的所得税，情况就比较复杂了。在内布拉斯加州，州所得税是联邦所得税的一定百分比，免税债券无需支付州所得税。据我所知，在纽约州和加利福尼亚州，如果发行免税债券的实体位于本州，则无需交纳州所得税，但是购买其他州的免税债券需要交纳州所得税。另外，纽约市的所得税法规定免除纽约州实体发行的免税债券的所得税，但是购买其他州的免税债券需要交税。我不是各州所得税方面的专家，也不想持续关注各州或各市税法的变化。请各位自行咨询当地的税收顾问。我上面简单说了一下我了解的情况，是为了提醒各位注意这个问题。在内布拉斯加州，在计算税后收益时，无需考虑免税债券的发行实体位于哪个州。当发行实体位于其他州并且需要在本地交纳税款时，你需要在本州交纳所得税，但是这笔税款可以在申报联邦所得税时扣除。具体税款是多少，每个人各不相同。另外，有些州还征收各种无形资产税，有的适用于所有免税债券，有的只适用于其他州发行的免税债券。内布拉斯加州没有这些税项，其他州的情况我不了解。

When bonds are bought at a discount from par and later are sold or mature (come due and get paid), the difference between the proceeds and cost is subject to capital gain or loss treatment. (There are minor exceptions to this statement as, unfortunately, there are to most general statements on investments and taxes but they will be pointed out to you should they affect any securities we recommend). This reduces the net after-tax yield by a factor involving the general rate of future capital gains taxes and the specific future tax position of the individual. Later on, we will discuss the impact of such capital gains taxes in calculating the relative attractiveness of discount bonds versus "full coupon" bonds.

买入债券时，买入价格低于面值，此后将债券卖出或债券到期时，税法规定将收益和成本之差按资本利得或损失处理。（这个情况有一些小例外。大部分关于投资和税项的一般陈述都总有例外。如果例外情况会影响到我们推荐的证券，我们会告诉你。）这样，税后净收益率会降低，具体降低多少，取决于将来的资本利得税税率以及个人的具体税率。在下文中，在计算贴现债券和“足额息票”债券哪个更合适时，我们会讨论资本利得税的影响。

Finally, one most important point. Although the law is not completely clear, you should probably not contemplate owning tax-free bonds if you have, or expect to have, general purpose bank or other indebtedness.

最后要说的是非常重要的一点。虽然税法的规定不是特别明确，但是如果你现在正在承担或将来打算承担一般的银行负债或其他债务，最好还是别考虑购买免税债券。

The law excludes the deductibility of interest on loans incurred or continued to purchase or carry tax-free bonds, and the interpretation of this statute will probably tend to be broadened as the years pass. For example, my impression is that you have no problem if you have a mortgage against real property (unless the debt was incurred in order to acquire municipal bonds) in deducting the mortgage interest on your Federal Tax return, even though you own tax-free bonds at the same time. However, I believe that if you have a general bank loan, even though the proceeds were directly used to purchase stocks, a handball court, etc. and the tax-free bonds are not used for security for the loan, you are asking for trouble if you deduct the interest and, at the same time, are the owner of tax-free bonds. Therefore, I would pay off bank loans before owning tax-free bonds, but I leave detailed examination of this question to you and your tax advisor. I merely mention it to make you aware of the potential problem.

税法规定，对于已经产生或持续产生的贷款，其利息不可用于抵税，不得购买或持有免税债券。将来这项规定的适用范围应该会加大。例如，根据我的理解，如果贷款买房，可以在申报联邦所得税时用房贷的利息抵税，就算同时持有免税债券也没问题。但是，如果承担着一般的银行贷款，就算将其用于直接购买股票或球场，免税债券不是贷款的抵押物，在报税时用贷款利息抵税会惹麻烦，因为你同时持有免税债券。如果是我的话，我会先把银行贷款还了，然后再买免税债券。具体到底该怎么做，请自行研究并咨询税收顾问。我只是提一下，告诉各位可能有这个问题。

# Marketability 债券的市场活跃程度

Tax-free bonds are materially different from common stocks or corporate bonds in that there are literally hundreds of thousands of issues, with the great majority having very few holders. This substantially inhibits the development of close, active markets. Whenever the City of New York or Philadelphia wants to raise money it sells perhaps twenty, thirty or forty non-identical securities, since it will offer an issue with that many different maturities. A 6% bond of New York coming due in 1980 is a different animal from a 6% bond of New York coming due in 1981. One cannot be exchanged for the other, and a seller has to find a buyer for the specific item he holds. When you consider that New York may offer bonds several times a year, it is easy to see why just this one city may have somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 issues outstanding. Grand Island, Nebraska may have 75 issues outstanding. The average amount of each issue might be $100,000 and the average number of holders may be six or eight per issue. Thus, it is absolutely impossible to have quoted markets at all times for all issues and spreads between bids and offers may be very wide. You can't set forth in the morning to buy a specific Grand Island issue of your choosing. It may not be offered at any price, anywhere, and if you do find one seller, there is no reason why he has to be realistic compared to other offerings of similar quality. On the other hand, there are single issues such as those of the Ohio Turnpike, Illinois Turnpike, etc. that amount to $200 million or more and have thousands of bondholders owning a single entirely homogeneous and interchangeable issue. Obviously, here you get a high degree of marketability.

免税债券与股票或公司债券存在很大差别，免税债券真的可能有几十万种，大部分品种都只有很少的持有者，因此很难形成交投活跃的市场。当纽约市或费城需要筹集资金时，它们可能会发行20、30、40只不同的证券，因为虽然是同一个品种，但它们要提供不同的到期期限。纽约发行的收益率为6%、1980年到期的债券，与纽约发行的收益率为6%、 1981年到期的债券，不是一个东西。这两个债券不能互换，必须要有买家，卖家才能把自己手里的债券卖出去。想想看，纽约一年要发行好几次债券，这一个城市就可能有将近1000只流通的债券。内布拉斯加州的格兰德岛都可能有75只流通的债券。每个品种的平均规模可能是100,000美元，每个品种的平均持有人数可能是6到8个人。债券品种这么多，根本不可能随时都有市场报价，而且买入价和卖出价之间的价差可能特别大。不是说你想买格兰德岛发行的某只债券，就能买得到。可能根本没有市场报价，就算你找到了一个卖家，他开的价格可能很离谱，比类似质地的其他债券贵很多。不是所有债券都这样。例如，俄亥俄州高速公路债、伊利诺伊州高速公路债等品种，它们的规模都在2亿美元以上，同一个可交易的债券品种，有成千上万的持有人。显然，这类债券的市场非常活跃。

My impression is that marketability is generally a function of the following three items, in descending order of importance: (1) the size of the particular issue; (2) the size of the issuer (a $100,000 issue of the State of Ohio will be more marketable than a $100,000 issue of Podunk, Ohio); and (3) the quality of the issuer. By far the most sales effort goes into the selling of new issues of bonds. An average of over $200 million per week of new issues comes up for sale, and the machinery of bond distribution is geared to get them sold, large or small. In my opinion, there is frequently insufficient differential in yield at time of issue for the marketability differences that will exist once the initial sales push is terminated. We have frequently run into markets in bonds where the spread between bid and asked prices may get to 15%. There is no need to buy bonds with the potential for such grotesque markets (although the profit spread to the dealer who originally offers them is frequently wider than on more marketable bonds) and we will not be buying them for you. The bonds we expect to buy will usually tend to have spreads (reflecting the difference between what you would pay net for such bonds on purchase and receive net on sale at the same point in time) of from 2% to 5%. Such a spread would be devastating if you attempted to trade in such bonds, but I don't believe it should be a deterrent for a long-term investor. The real necessity is to stay away from bonds of very limited marketability - which frequently are the type local bond dealers have the greatest monetary incentive to push.

按我的理解，债券的市场活跃程度主要受三个因素影响，按重要程度依次是：（1）债券的规模；（2）发行人的实力（同样是100,000美元规模的债券，一个是俄亥俄州发行的，一个是俄亥俄州一个无名小镇发行的，前者的市场比后者更活跃）；（3）发行人的口碑。目前，在债券市场中，推销最多的是新发行的债券。每周新发行的债券规模在2亿美元以上。债券发行市场的重点是把这些债券卖出去，无论它们的规模是大是小。所有的债券，在刚开始发行的时候，都被大力推销。推销结束后，各个债券的市场活跃程度各不相同，但是它们发行时的收益率却没有足够的差别，没充分反映推销结束后不同的市场活跃程度。我们在市场中经常会看到买入价和卖出价之间的价差达到15%的现象。何必买可能出现这种怪异行情的债券？此类债券没有活跃的市场，但交易商推销这些债券可以获得更高的利润。我们不会给大家买这样的债券。我们打算购买的债券的价差（即同一时间买入和卖出之间的差价）在2%到5%之间。你要是频繁交易的话，这个价差就实在太高了，但是对于长期投资者来说，算不了什么。关键是要远离市场活跃度低迷的债券，这些一般来说正是债券交易商最愿意推销的品种，它们推销这些债券更有利可图。

# Specific Areas of Purchase 具体购买什么债券

We will probably concentrate our purchases in the following general areas:

我们可能会选择购买以下类型的债券：

> (1) Large revenue-producing public entities such as toll roads, electric power districts, water districts, etc. Many of these issues possess high marketability, are subject to quantitative analysis, and sometimes have favorable sinking fund or other factors which tend not to receive full valuation in the market place.

> （1）收费公路、电力、水务等拥有巨额收入的大型公共事业公司发行的债券。许多此类债券的市场活跃程度非常高，很容易对发行主体进行定量分析，有的设有偿债基金，有的还具有其他有利因素，但被市场忽略了，没得到公允估值。

> (2) Industrial Development Authority bonds which arise when a public entity holds title to property leased to a private corporation. For example, Lorain, Ohio holds title to an $80 million project for U.S. Steel Corp. The Development Authority Board issued bonds to pay for the project and has executed a net and absolute lease with U.S. Steel to cover the bond payments. The credit of the city or state is not behind the bonds and they are only as good as the company that is on the lease. Many top-grade corporations stand behind an aggregate of several billion dollars of these obligations, although new ones are being issued only in small amounts ($5 million per project or less) because of changes in the tax laws. For a period of time there was a very substantial prejudice against such issues, causing them to sell at yields considerably higher than those commensurate with their inherent credit standing. This prejudice has tended to diminish, reducing the premium yields available, but I still consider it a most attractive field. Our insurance company owns a majority of its bonds in this category.

> （2）政府工业发展债券。有的政府部门将资产租赁给私营公司，这些政府部门可以发行此类债券。例如，俄亥俄州洛兰市拥有一个8000万美元的项目，租赁给了美国钢铁公司。政府发展部门发行债券筹集项目所需资金，并与美国钢铁公司签订绝对净租赁合约，用于偿还债券款项。为此类债券做信用背书的不是相关城市或州，这些债券的信用如何，主要取决于承租的公司。此类债券规模有几十亿，背后是许多大公司在支持，但是由于税法的变化，新发行的此类债券规模很小（每个项目平均不到500万美元）。在很长一段时间里，由于人们对此类债券存在很大的偏见，与信用状况类似的债券相比，它们的收益率高得多。人们的这种偏见在逐渐减弱，此类债券的溢价收益率也在降低，但是我觉得它们的收益率还是相当高的。我们的保险公司持有的大部分债券都是这个类型的。

> (3) Public Housing Authority Issues for those of you who wish the very highest grade of tax-free bonds. In effect, these bonds bear the guarantee of the U.S. Government, so they are all rated AAA. In states where local taxes put a premium on buying in-state issues, and I can’t fill your needs from (1) and (2) , my tendency would be to put you into Housing Authority issues rather than try to select from among credits that I don't understand. If you direct me to buy obligations of your home state, you should expect substantial quantities of Housing Authority issues. There is no need to diversify among such issues, as they all represent the top credit available.

> （3）如果你希望购买评级最高的免税债券，可以选择公共住房管理局发行的品种。这些债券由美国政府担保，它们的评级都是AAA。在有些州，受当地税法影响，本州发行的品种具有溢价，而且前两类债券都不符合你的需求，我会向你推荐公共住房管理局发行的品种，我不会从其他债券中选择，因为我不了解它们的信用状况。要是各位要求我购买你们所在州的债券，提前知会各位一下，我可能购买大量公共住房管理局发行的品种。此类品种用不着分散，它们的信用评级是最高的。

> (4) State obligations of a direct or indirect nature.

> （4）州政府直接或间接承担的债务。

You will notice I am not buying issues of large cities. I don't have the faintest idea how to analyze a New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, etc. (a friend mentioned the other day when Newark was trying to sell bonds at a very fancy rate that the Mafia was getting very upset because Newark was giving them a bad name). Your analysis of a New York City - and I admit it is hard to imagine them not paying their bills for any extended period of time - would be as good as mine. My approach to bonds is pretty much like my approach to stocks. If I can't understand something, I tend to forget it. Passing an opportunity which I don't understand - even if someone else is perceptive enough to analyze it and get paid well for doing it - doesn't bother me. All I want to be sure of is that I get paid well for the things I do feel capable of handling - and that I am right when I make affirmative decisions.

讲到这，我也没提大城市发行的品种。该如何分析纽约市、芝加哥市、费城，我一无所知。（有一次，一个朋友对我说，纽瓦克市发行了收益率很高的债券，当地的黑手党很不高兴，觉得纽瓦克给他们丢脸了。）就拿纽约市来说，我承认，纽约市不太可能长期拖欠债务，但是要对纽约市进行具体分析，我做的分析不会你做的分析强多少。我研究债券的方法和研究股票差不多。有看不懂的，就跳过去。一个机会，我看不懂，就跳过去，就算别人很高明，能分析明白，而且能赚大钱，我也不在意。我最关心的是：我能从我能看懂的机会里赚钱，能把我能做对的判断做对。我们打算给你们大多数人购买5到10个品种。如果你只让我买你所在州的债券，我买的品种会少一些，可能仅限于公共住房管理局发行的债券。我们购买的单笔金额最好不低于25,000美元，规模能大一些的话，还是大一些比较好。小规模的债券在转卖的时候一般会非常吃亏。这个情况，你在买10,000美元的债券的时候，债券推销员一般不告诉你，在你往外卖的时候，他们才和你说。在二级市场，当卖家因为规模较小而给出较低的报价时，我们可能会破例，买入较小规模的债券。

We will probably tend to purchase somewhere between five and ten issues for most of you. However, if you wish to limit me to your home state, it may be fewer issues - and perhaps those will only be Housing Authorities. We will try not to buy in smaller than $25,000 pieces and will prefer larger amounts where appropriate. Smaller lots of bonds are usually penalized upon resale, sometimes substantially. The bond salesman doesn't usually explain this to you when you buy the $10,000 of bonds from him, but it gets explained when you later try to sell the $10,000 to him. We may make exceptions where we are buying secondary market issues in smaller pieces - but only if we are getting an especially good price on the buy side because of the small size of the offering.


# Callable Bonds 可赎回债券

We will not buy bonds where the issuer of the bonds has a right to call (retire) the bonds on a basis which substantially loads the contract in his favor. It is amazing to me to see people buy bonds which are due in forty years, but where the issuer has the right to call the bonds at a tiny premium in five or ten years. Such a contract essentially means that you have made a forty year deal if it is advantageous to the issuer (and disadvantageous to you) and a five year deal if the initial contract turns out to be advantageous to you (and disadvantageous to the issuer). Such contracts are really outrageous and exist because bond investors can't think through the implications of such a contract form and bond dealers don't insist on better terms for their customers. One extremely interesting fact is that bonds with very unattractive call features sell at virtually the same yield as otherwise identical bonds which are noncallable.

有的债券发行人有权将债券赎回，赎回条款对债券发行人非常有利，我们不买这样的债券。有的债券是40年后到期的，但是发行人有权在5或10年后以微小的溢价赎回，怎么能有人买这样的债券呢？这样的条款其实是这个意思：签订最初的合同之后，根据将来的情况变化，如果对发行人有利（对你不利），那就是40年的期限；如果对你有利（对发行人不利），那就是5年期限。这样的合同条款太不合理了。怎么能有这样的合同条款呢？因为债券投资者不明白这里面的状况，债券交易商也不会主动为客户争取权益。市场上有这样一种现象：两只完全相同的债券，一只具有非常不公平的赎回条款，另一只是不可赎回的，但收益率竟然一样，实在是让人难以理解。

It should be pointed out that most Nebraska bonds carry highly unfair call provisions. Despite this severe contractual disadvantage, they do not offer higher yields than bonds with more equitable terms.

其实，内布拉斯加州的大多数债券都具有非常不公平的赎回条款。可赎回条款对持有人不公平，而且收益率还和不可赎回债券差不多。

One way to avoid this problem is to buy bonds which are totally noncallable. Another way is to buy discount bonds where the right of the issuer to call the bond is at a price so far above your cost as to render the possible call inconsequential. If you buy a bond at 60 which is callable at 103, the effective cost to you of granting the issuer the right to prematurely terminate the contract (which is a right you never have) is insignificant. But to buy a bond of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power at 100 to come due at 100 in 1999 or to come due at 104 in 1974, depending on which is to the advantage of the issuer and to your disadvantage, is the height of foolishness when comparable yields are available on similar credits without such an unfair contract. Nevertheless, just such a bond was issued in October, 1969 and similar bonds continue to be issued every day. I only write at such length about an obvious point, since it is apparent from the continual sale of such bonds that many investors haven't the faintest notion how this loads the dice against them and many bond salesmen aren't about to tell them.

要避免这种不公平的条款，有两个办法：一个办法是买入完全不可赎回的债券；另一个办法是在买入价远远低于发行人的赎回价时，买入折价的债券，这就不怕赎回了。举个例子，一只债券的赎回价是103，你在60的时候买，虽然发行人有提前终止合约的权利（你却没这个权利），你也可以毫不在乎。洛杉矶水电局有一只债券，可以1999年到期，按100美元赎回，也可以1974年到期，按104美元赎回，发行人可以按对自己有利、但对持有人不利的情况选择何时赎回。本来有别的信用差不多的债券，而且不存在这种不公平的条款，收益率也差不多，有人还买洛杉矶水电局的这只债券，真是傻到家了。尽管如此，1969年10月，市场上就发行了这样一只债券，类似的债券每天都在发行。这个事是明摆着的，但我还是花了这么多篇幅写，因为这种债券还是一直在发售。显然许多投资者根本就不明白这种债券对自己多不公平，许多债券推销员也不想告诉他们。

# Maturity and the Mathematics of Bonds 债券的期限和计算

Many people, in buying bonds, select maturities based on how long they think they are going to want to hold bonds, how long they are going to live, etc. While this is not a silly approach, it is not necessarily the most logical. The primary determinants in selection of maturity should probably be (1) the shape of the yield curve; (2) your expectations regarding future levels of interest rates and (3) the degree of quotational fluctuation you are willing to endure or hope to possibly profit from. Of course, (2) is the most important but by far the most difficult upon which to comment intelligently.

许多买债券的人在选择期限时的依据是，他们觉得要持有债券多长时间，或者他们觉得自己能活多长时间。这种做法没什么大错，但不是最符合逻辑的。选择债券期限的主要决定因素有三点：（1）收益率曲线的形状；（2）你对将来利率的预期；（3）报价波动有多大，你是否承受得了，是否想从中获利。这里面的第二点最重要，也是最不好说的。

Let's tackle the yield curve first. When other aspects of quality are identical, there will be a difference in interest rates paid based upon the length of the bond being offered. For example, a top grade bond being offered now might have a yield of 4.75% if it came due in six or nine months, 5.00% in two years, 5.25% in five years, 5.50% in ten years and 6.25% in twenty years. When long rates are substantially higher than short rates, the curve is said to be strongly positive. In the U. S. Government bond market, rates recently have tended to produce a negative yield curve; that is, a long term Government bond over the last year or so has consistently yielded less than a short term one. Sometimes the yield curve has been very flat, and sometimes it is positive out to a given point, such as ten years, and then flattens out. What you should understand is that it varies, often very substantially, and that on an historical basis the present slope tends to be in the high positive range. This doesn't mean that long bonds are going to be worth more but it does mean that you are being paid more to extend maturity than in many periods. If yields remained constant for several years, you would do better with longer bonds than shorter bonds, regardless of how long you intended to hold them.

我们先讲收益率曲线。在各方面的质地都相同的情况下，债券的期限不同，利率也不一样。以当前评级最高的债券为例，期限为6到9个月的，收益率是4.75％；2年的，5.00％；5年的，5.25％；10年的，5.50％；20年的，6.25％。当长期利率远高于短期利率时，我们说收益率曲线向上倾斜。在美国政府债券市场，最近的收益率曲线是向下倾斜的，在过去一年里，长期政府债券的收益率始终低于短期债券。有时候收益率曲线是非常平坦的，有时候是向上倾斜，然后趋于平坦（例如，向上倾斜十年，之后趋于平坦）。各位需要知道的是，收益率曲线会经常出现显著变化。从历史情况来看，当前的收益率曲线可能会出现向上倾斜的情况。在这种情况下，长期债券不会更值钱，只是和其他时期相比，购买期限更长的债券，获得的利息更高。如果收益率在几年内保持不变，则无论你打算持有多长时间，期限较长的债券都会比期限较短的债券给你带来更多的收益。

The second factor in determining maturity selection is expectations regarding future rate levels. Anyone who has done much predicting in this field has tended to look very foolish very fast. I did not regard rates as unattractive one year ago, and I was proved very wrong almost immediately. I believe present rates are not unattractive and I may look foolish again. Nevertheless, a decision has to be made and you can make just as great a mistake if you buy short term securities now and rates available on reinvestment in a few years are much lower.

在选择债券期限时，第二个要考虑的因素是将来的利率水平。经常预测利率的人总是被打脸。一年前，我觉得利率不低，没过多长时间，事实就表明我完全错了。现在我也觉得利率不低，事实可能还会证明我不对。不管怎么样，判断是必须做的。你要是决定现在买短期品种，结果过几年再投资时利率大跌，你也一样是犯了大错。

The final factor involves your tolerance for quotational fluctuation. This involves the mathematics of bond investment and may be a little difficult for you to understand. Nevertheless, it is important that you get a general grasp of the principles. Let's assume for the moment a perfectly flat yield curve and a non-callable bond. Further assume present rates are 5% and that you buy two bonds, one due in two years and one due in twenty years. Now assume one year later that yields on new issues have gone to 3% and that you wish to sell your bonds. Forgetting about market spreads, commissions, etc. , you will receive $1,019.60 for the original two year $1,000 bond (now with one year to run) and $1,288.10 for the nineteen year bond (originally twenty years). At these prices, a purchaser will get exactly 3% on his money after amortizing the premium he has paid and cashing the stream of 5% coupons attached to each bond. It is a matter of indifference to him whether to buy your nineteen year 5% bond at $1,288.10 or a new 3% bond (which we have assumed is the rate current - one year later) at $1,000.00. On the other hand, let's assume rates went to 7%. Again we will ignore commissions, capital gains taxes on the discount, etc. Now the buyer will only pay $981.00 for the bond with one year remaining until maturity and $791.60 for the bond with nineteen years left. Since he can get 7% on new issues, he is only willing to buy your bond at a discount sufficient so that accrual of this discount will give him the same economic benefits from your 5% coupon that a 7% coupon at $1,000.00 would give him.

最后要考虑的是，你能否承受得起市场报价的波动。这里面涉及债券投资的数学计算，理解起来可能有难度，但是你必须要知道是怎么算的。现在假设收益率曲线完全是平的，债券是不可赎回的。再假设当前的利率是5％，你买了两只债券，一只是2 年后到期，一只是20年后到期。假设一年后，新发行债券的收益率变成了3％，你想把自己的债券卖了。完全忽略市场差价、手续费等因素，原来买的2年期债券（现在剩一年了）能卖 1，019.60美元，原来的20年期债券（现在剩19年了）能卖1，288.10美元。按这些价格，对于买家来说，将支付的溢价摊销并将每只债券5％的现金流兑现后，获得的恰好是3％的收益率。对于买家来说，是支付1,288.10美元买你的票面利率为5％的19年期债券，还是支付1,000.00美元买新发行的票面利率为3％的债券（我们假设一年后的现行利率是3％），没任何区别。再假设利率变成了7％，还是不考虑手续费、资本利得税等因素。现在那只还有一年到期的债券，买家只会出981.00美元，那只还有19年到期的，只会出 791.60美元。因为他能买到利率为7％的新发行的债券，所以只有你的债券有折价，折价购买你票面利率为5％的债券和以 1,000.00 美元购买票面利率为7％的债券收益相同时，他才会买你的。

The principle is simple. The wider the swings in interest rates and the longer the bond, the more the value of a bond can go up or down on an interim basis before maturity. It should be pointed out in the first example where rates went to 3%, our long term bond would only have appreciated to about $1,070.00 if it had been callable in five years at par, although it would have gone down just as much if 7% rates had occurred. This just illustrates the inherent unfairness of call provisions.

道理很简单。利率的波动越大、债券的期限越长，在到期之前，债券价值越容易出现暂时性的大起大落。有一点要指出的是，在第一个例子中，我们假设利率变成3％，如果我们购买的长期债券可以在五年后以面值赎回，那么它只能升到1,070.00美元，但是如果利率上涨到7％，这只债券跌的一样多。这说明了赎回条款是不合理的。

For over two decades, interest rates on tax-free bonds have almost continuously gone higher and buyers of long term bonds have continuously suffered. This does not mean it is bad now to buy long term bonds - it simply means that the illustration in the above paragraph has worked in only one direction for a long period of time and people are much more conscious of the downside risks from higher rates than the upside potential from lower ones.

在过去二十年里，免税债券的利率一直在上涨，购买长期债券的投资者一直很吃亏。虽然如此，不是说买长期债券就不好。我们在上面的例子中讲了利率的上下波动，但在过去很长一段时间里，利率一直只朝一个方向波动。和以前相比，现在人们越来越觉得利率比较高，可能要下调了，而不是觉得利率太低，还有上升空间。

If it is a 50-50 chance as to the future general level of interest rates and the yield curve is substantially positive, then the odds are better in buying long term non-callable bonds than shorter term ones. This reflects my current conclusion and, therefore, I intend to buy bonds within the ten to twenty-five year range. If you have any preferences within that range, we will try to select bonds reflecting such preferences, but if you are interested in shorter term bonds, we will not be able to help you as we are not searching out bonds in this area.

将来的普遍利率水平可能高，也可能低，概率是对半开，而且当前的收益率曲线是显著向上倾斜的，与买入短期债券相比，还是买长期不可赎回的债券赢面比较大。这是我现在得出的结论，所以我打算买入期限为10到20年的债券。如果你也看好这个期限范围内的债券，我们可以帮你挑选。如果你想买期限较短的，我们就帮不上忙了，因为我们没研究期限较短的。

Before you decide to buy a twenty year bond, go back and read the paragraph showing how prices change based upon changes in interest rates. Of course, if you hold the bond straight through, you are going to get the contracted rate of interest, but if you sell earlier, you are going to be subject to the mathematical forces described in that paragraph, for better or for worse. Bond prices also change because of changes in quality over the years but, in the tax-free area, this has tended to be - and probably will continue to be - a relatively minor factor compared to the impact of changes in the general structure of interest rates.

请先回头阅读债券价格如何因利率变化而变动的部分，然后再决定是否购买20年期的债券。如果你一直持有到期，你会获得合约规定的利率，如果你提前卖出，会受到我们已经计算过的情形的影响，可能赚，也可能赔。在很长时间内，债券质地会逐渐发生变化，债券价格也因此产生变动。但是对于免税债券来说，无论在现在还是将来，引起价格变动的主要因素还是利率的变化。

# Discount Versus Full Coupon Bonds 折价债券与足额息票债券

You will have noticed in the above discussion that if you now wanted to buy a 7% return on a nineteen year bond, you had a choice between buying a new nineteen year bond with a 7% coupon rate or buying a bond with a 5% coupon at $791.60, which would pay you $1,000.00 in nineteen years. Either purchase would have yielded exactly 7% compounded semi-annually to you. Mathematically, they are the same. In the case of tax-free bonds the equation is complicated, however, by the fact that the $70.00 coupon is entirely tax-free to you, whereas the bond purchased at a discount gives you tax-free income of $50.00 per year but a capital gain at the end of the nineteenth year of $208.40. Under the present tax law, you would owe anything from a nominal tax, if the gain from realization of the discount was your only taxable income in the nineteenth year, up to a tax of over $70.00 if it came on top of very large amounts of capital gain at that time (the new tax law provides for capital gain rates of 35%, and even slightly higher on an indirect basis in 1972 and thereafter for those realizing very large gains.) In addition to this, you might have some state taxes to pay on the capital gain.

在前面的内容里，你可能注意到了，现在要买一只收益率为7％、期限为19年的债券的话，你有两个选择：一个是买入票面利率为7％、期限为19年的债券；另一个是买入票面利率为5％、价格为791.60美元、19年后支付给你1,000.00 美元的债券。每半年计算一次复利，买这两只债券都恰好可以实现7％的收益率。从数学计算上来看，这两只债券没差别。如果买的是免税债券，就有些复杂了。70.00美元的利息是完全免税的。折价买入的那只债券，每年50美元的利息是免税的，但是在19年后有208.40美元的资本利得。按照现行税法，如果你只有这一部分实现的折价收益需要交纳资本利得税，只要交很少的税就行了；如果你除了这笔收益，还有其他金额很大的资本利得，则最多可能交纳70多美元的税（新税法规定资本利得税税率是35％，1972年，金额较大的资本利得，税率略高于35％）。除此之外，可能还要因这部分资本利得而交纳州政府征收的税款。

Obviously, under these circumstances you are not going to pay the $791.60 for the 5% coupon and feel you are equally as well off as with the 7% coupon at $1,000.00. Neither is anyone else. Therefore, identical quality securities with identical maturities sell at considerably higher gross yields when they have low coupons and are priced at discounts than if they bear current high coupons.

显然，考虑到上述因素，你不会支付791.60美元买票面利率为5％的债券，而是会选择支付1,000.00 美元买票面利率为7％的债券。别人和你想的一样。正因为如此，质地相同、期限相同的债券，如果票面利率较低而且存在折价，那么与当前票面利率较高的债券相比，折价债券的毛收益率会更高一些。

Interestingly enough, for most taxpayers, such higher gross yields over-compensate for the probable tax to be paid. This is due to several factors. First, no one knows what the tax law will be when the bonds mature and it is both natural and probably correct to assume the tax rate will be stiffer at that time than now. Second, even though a 5% coupon on a $1,000.00 bond purchased at $791.60 due in nineteen years is the equivalent of a 7% coupon on a $1,000.00 bond purchased at par with the same maturity, people prefer to get the higher current return in their pocket. The owner of the 5% coupon bond is only getting around 6.3% current yield on his $791.60 with the balance necessary to get him up to 7% coming from the extra $208.40 he picks up at the end. Finally, the most important factor affecting prices currently on discount bonds (and which will keep affecting them) is that banks have been taken out of the market as buyers of discount tax-free bonds by changes brought about in bank tax treatment through the 1969 Tax Reform Act. Banks have historically been the largest purchasers and owners of tax-free bonds and anything that precludes them from one segment of the market has dramatic effects on the supply-demand situation in that segment. This may tend to give some edge to individuals in the discount tax-free market, particularly those who are not likely to be in a high tax bracket when the bonds mature or are sold.

有意思的是，对于大多数人来说，由此产生的较高的毛收益率带来的补偿高于可能要支付的税款。原因有几点。首先，谁都不知道债券到期后税法会怎么规定，先假设将来的税率比现在高，也有道理。其次，一只债券票面利率为5％、面值为1,000.00美元、期限为19年、价格为791.60美元，另一只债券票面利率 7％、面值为1,000.00美元、期限相同、价格为面值，人们还是愿意选能现在就把较高的收益装在口袋里的。持有票面利率为5％的债券，支付791.60美元，获得的当前收益率只有6.3％左右，到期后得到208.40 美元才能实现 7％的收益率。最后要说的一点是当前乃至将来影响折价债券价格的最重要因素，由于1969年《税法改革法案》中的银行税制改革规定，银行不会再参与购买折价免税债券了。银行一直以来都是免税债券的最大买家和持有者。现在它们不能参与折价免税债券的买卖了，对这个细分市场的供求关系造成了重大影响。这样一来，有些个人投资者在折价免税债券市场中可能更有优势，特别是那些在将来债券到期或卖出时税档比较低的个人投资者。

If I can get a significantly higher effective after-tax yield (allowing for sensible estimates of your particular future tax rate possibilities), I intend to purchase discount bonds for you. I know some partners prefer full coupon bonds, even though their effective yield is less, since they prefer to maximize the current cash yield and if they will so advise me, we will stick to full coupon issues (or very close thereto) in their cases.

在充分合理的估算你将来的税率的前提下，如果实际税后收益率特别高，我会帮你购买折价债券。我知道有些合伙人更愿意买足额息票债券，尽管它们的实际收益率较低，但他们想获得较高的当前现金收益率。如果你是这样的情况，请告诉我，我们会帮你选择足额息票债券。

# Procedure 流程安排

I intend to be in the office solidly through March (including every Saturday except March 7th) and will be glad to see any partner or talk with him by phone. To aid in scheduling, please make an appointment with Gladys (or me). The only request I make is that you absorb as much as possible of this letter before we talk. As you can see, it would be an enormous problem if I had to explain each item to all of you.

我计划整个三月份都留在办公室（包括星期六，3月7日除外），任何合伙人都可以和我面谈或通过电话交谈。为了方便安排时间，请联系格拉迪斯或我预约。我对各位就一个请求，我们交谈之前，请务必尽量读懂这封信的内容。大家读完这封信也能明白，要是所有内容都要向每个合伙人重复讲一遍，实在不可能。

If you decide you want us to help you in buying bonds, you should let us know:

如果需要我们帮助购买债券，你需要告诉我们下列信息：

> (1)  Whether you want to restrict purchases to your home state for local tax reasons;

> （1）是否出于本地征税原因考虑，只希望购买本州发行的债券；

> (2)  Whether you want to restrict us to full coupon issues or let us use our judgment as to where you get the best value;

> （2）是否只想购买足额息票债券，还是允许我们自由选择最佳品种；

> (3)  Your preference as to maturity in the ten to twenty-five year range or if you prefer to let us use our judgment in that area;

> （3）在10年到20年的范围内，你打算购买多少年期限的，还是允许我们 替你选择；

> (4)  How much you want to invest - we may end up several per cent short of the figure you name, but we will never go over;

> （4）你要投资的金额是多少，我们买入的金额可能略低于你指定的数字，但不 会超过你所说的金额；

> (5)  On what bank the bonds should be drafted.

> （5）债券应该交付到哪个银行。

We will advise you by phone or letter as we buy bonds. Bill and John will be doing much of the mechanical work. Needless to say, none of us will have any financial interest in any transaction. Should you have any questions regarding the mechanics, please direct them to John or Bill as I will probably be swamped and they will be more familiar with specific transactions. After March 31st, I don't expect to be around the office for several months. Therefore, if you want to talk things over, come in by then. The completion of all purchases may go into April, but Bill will be taking care of this and the mechanics will all be set up.

在买入债券时，我们会通过电话或信件为你提供建议。具体的操作，主要由比尔和 约翰负责。在任何一笔交易中，我们中的任何人都不会从中获取任何利润，这个不 必说了。如有具体操作相关问题，请咨询约翰或比尔，因为我可能忙不过来，而且 在具体交易方面，他们更熟悉。3月31日后的几个月时间里，我应该不会经常去 办公室。如果有事的话，请在3月31日之前找我。所有交易可能要4月份才能 完成，具体操作由比尔负责。

You should realize that because of the enormous diversity of issues mentioned earlier, it is impossible to say just what will be bought. Sometimes the tax-free bond market has more similarities to real estate than to stocks. There are hundreds of thousands of items of varying comparability, some with no sellers, some with reluctant sellers and some with eager sellers. Which may be the best buy depends on the quality of what is being offered, how well it fits your needs and the eagerness of the seller. The standard of comparison is always new issues where an average of several hundred million dollars worth have to be sold each week - however, specific secondary market opportunities (issues already outstanding) may be more attractive than new issues and we can only find out how attractive they are when we are ready to make bids.

信里说了，债券的品种太多了，现在我们说不好会买哪些。免税债券市场不太像股 市，更像房地产市场。几十万个品种，各有各的特点，有些是没卖家的，有些是卖家 不愿卖的，有些是卖家急着卖的。买哪个最好呢？我们要选质地最好的、最符合你的 需求的，而且卖家愿意往外卖的。每周都有几亿美元的新债券发行，这些新发行的品 种是我们参照比较的标准。有些在二级市场上已经流通的债券可能比新发行的更合 适。具体如何，只有在准备买的时候，才能知道。

Although markets can change, it looks as if we will have no difficulty in getting in the area of 6-1/2% after tax (except from Housing Authority issues) on bonds in the twenty-year maturity range.

市场是变化的，但是从现在的情况看，期限为20年、税收收益率为6.5%左右（公 共住房管理局发行的品种除外）的债券，应该很容易就能买到。
