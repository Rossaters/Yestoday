1957 Letter

SECOND ANNUAL LETTER TO LIMITED PARTNERS

# The General Stock Market Picture in 1957 1957年股票市场整体情况

In last year's letter to partners, I said the following:

在去年致合伙人的信中，我这样描述：

My view of the general market level is that it is priced above intrinsic value. This view relates to blue-chip securities. This view, if accurate, carries with it the possibility of a substantial decline in all stock prices, both undervalued and otherwise. In any event I think the probability is very slight that current market levels will be thought of as cheap five years from now. Even a full-scale bear market, however, should not hurt the market value of our work-outs substantially.

我对股票市场的看法是它的价格高出了内在价值。这种看法主要是针对蓝筹股。更确切地说，这种看法是指所有股票的价格都有可能大幅下降，不管是低估的还是其他的股票。无论如何，我认为目前的市场价格看起来和五年后一样便宜的可能性很低。但是，即使是大熊市，也很难对我们的“Workouts”[^1]投资有很大伤害。  

If the general market were to return to an undervalued status our capital might be employed exclusively in general issues and perhaps some borrowed money would be used in this operation at that time. Conversely, if the market should go considerably higher our policy will be to reduce our general issues as profits present themselves and increase the work-out portfolio.

如果整个市场转回到低估状态，我们的资金或许将会只布署在“Generals”投资上，而且可能会借入部分资金投资。相反，如果市场涨幅较大，我们将会减少“Generals”投资以便获取利润，并增加“Workouts”投资。

All of the above is not intended to imply that market analysis is foremost in my mind. Primary attention is given at all times to the detection of substantially undervalued securities.

上述说法并不意味着我认为市场分析应占据最重要的位置。我主要且一直关注的是寻找被大幅低估的证券。

The past year witnessed a moderate decline in stock prices. I stress the word "moderate" since casual reading of the press or conversing with those who have had only recent experience with stocks would tend to create an impression of a much greater decline. Actually, it appears to me that the decline in stock prices has been considerably less than the decline in corporate earning power under present business conditions. This means that the public is still very bullish on blue chip stocks and the general economic picture. I make no attempt to forecast either business or the stock market; the above is simply intended to dispel any notions that stocks have suffered any drastic decline or that the general market, is at a low level. I still consider the general market to be priced on the high side based on long term investment value.

过去的一年见证了股票价格的温和下降。我特别强调“温和”这个词，是因为不经意浏览这封信的人以及最近才有少许股市经验的人可能会认为股价下降太多。实际上，我认为股价的下降要小于当前状况下企业盈利能力的下降。这意味着，大众对于蓝筹股和整体经济前景仍旧看好。我并不试图去预测企业或股票市场，只是试图摒弃那些认为股价已经降低太多、股市已经处于低位的观点。我仍旧认为以长期投资价值来看，股市总体价格仍处于高位。

# Our Activities in 1957 我们在1957年的操作 

The market decline has created greater opportunity among undervalued situations so that, generally, our portfolio is heavier in undervalued situations relative to work-outs than it was last year. Perhaps an explanation of the term "work-out" is in order. A work-out is an investment which is dependent on a specific corporate action for its profit rather than a general advance in the price of the stock as in the case of undervalued situations. Work-outs come about through: sales, mergers, liquidations, tenders, etc. In each case, the risk is that something will upset the applecart and cause the abandonment of the planned action, not that the economic picture will deteriorate and stocks decline generally. At the end of 1956, we had a ratio of about 70-30 between general issues and work-outs. Now it is about 85-15.

股市的下跌给我们创造了买入低估股票的机会，所以总体来说，相比去年我们投资在低估股票上的资金要多于在“Workouts”上的资金。或许需要解释一下什么是“Workouts”，它不同于投资被低估股票以获取价格回归的收益，它的收益主要取决于特定的企业行为，这些行为有：出售、兼并、清算、回购等等。这类投资的风险在于发生某些情况导致放弃原先的计划，而不是经济前景的恶化或整个股票市场的下跌。在1956年底，我们在“Generals”和“Workouts”的投资比例是70:30，现在是85:15。

During the past year we have taken positions in two situations which have reached a size where we may expect to take some part in corporate decisions. One of these positions accounts for between 10% and 20% of the portfolio of the various partnerships and the other accounts for about 5%. Both of these will probably take in the neighborhood of three to five years of work but they presently appear to have potential for a high average annual rate of return with a minimum of risk. While not in the classification of work-outs, they have very little dependence on the general action of the stock market. Should the general market have a substantial rise, of course, I would expect this section of our portfolio to lag behind the action of the market.

去年，我们有两项投资已经达到了一定的规模，或许可以让我们在一定程度上参与企业的决策。其中一项投资占我们所有合伙基金的10%-20%，另一项投资占比约5%。这两项投资或许要三到五年才能见效，不过现在看来他们可能会在低风险的情况下获取较高的年化收益率。虽然这两项投资均不在“Workouts”之列，但他们跟整体市场的关系不大。当然，如果整体市场大幅上升，相较于市场表现，这部分投资可能会拖后腿。 

# Results for 1957 1957年的投资成果

In 1957 the three partnerships which we formed in 1956 did substantially better than the general market. At the beginning of the year, the Dow-Jones Industrials stood at 499 and at the end of the year it was at 435 for a loss of 64 points. If one had owned the Averages, he would have received 22 points in dividends reducing the overall loss to 42 points or 8.470% for the year. This loss is roughly equivalent to what would have been achieved by investing in most investment funds and, to my knowledge, no investment fund invested in stocks showed a gain for the year.

在1957年，我们成立于1956年的3个合伙基金都比市场整体表现要好的多。年初，道琼斯工业指数是499点，年底是435点，降低了64点。如果一个人拥有这个指数，他将会有22点的分红，使得损失降低到42点，也就是亏损了8.47%。这个损失率基本上等同于大多数的投资基金，并且据我所知，今年没有哪个股票类投资基金的收益为正。

All three of the 1956 partnerships showed a gain during the year amounting to about 6.2%, 7.8% and 25% on yearend 1956 net worth. Naturally a question is created as to the vastly superior performance of the last partnership, particularly in the mind of the partners of the first two. This performance emphasizes the importance of luck in the short run, particularly in regard to when funds are received. The third partnership was started the latest in 1956 when the market was at a lower level and when several securities were particularly attractive. Because of the availability of funds, large positions were taken in these issues. Whereas the two partnerships formed earlier were already substantially invested so that they could only take relatively small positions in these issues.

以1956年底的净资产计算，我们的三个合伙基金的收益率分别为：6.2%、7.8%、25%。一些人对于第三个合伙基金的超高表现可能会有所疑问，特别是前两个合伙基金的合伙人。这种表现只能说是短期内的幸运，特别是因为这个合伙基金成立的时间。第三个合伙基金成立于1956年年底，那时的市场处于低位，而且部分证券价格相当有吸引力。这个基金一成立就可以将大笔资金投资在这些证券上。而前两个基金已经投资了相当多的资金，只能再投资相对较少的资金了。

Basically, all partnerships are invested in the same securities and in approximately the same percentages. However, particularly during the initial stages, money becomes available at varying times and varying levels of the market so there is more variation in results than is likely to be the case in later years. Over the years, I will be quite satisfied with a performance that is 10% per year better than the Averages, so in respect to these three partnerships, 1957 was a successful and probably better than average, year.

实际上，所有的合伙基金都投资于相同的证券，也几乎是相同的比例。但是因为成立时间的不同，对应着不同的投资时间和市场状态，所以相较于以后若干年，今年的结果有较大的偏离。若干年后，如果能够获得超出市场平均收益率10个点的收益率，我就会相当满意了。这样看来，对于我们的3个合伙基金，1957年是一个成功且可能高于平均收益的一年。

Two partnerships were started during the middle of 1957 and their results for the balance of the year were roughly the same as the performance of the Averages which were down about 12% for the period since inception of the 1957 partnerships. Their portfolios are now starting to approximate those of the 1956 partnerships and performance of the entire group should be much more comparable in the future.

1957年中我们又成立了2个合伙基金，他们的表现跟市场整体情况趋同，从成立时起大概下跌了12%。现在，这些合伙基金的投资组合基本上接近于1956年成立的合伙基金了，所以将来所有的合伙基金表现将会趋同。

# Interpretation of results 对于投资成果的解读

To some extent our better than average performance in 1957 was due to the fact that it was a generally poor year for most stocks. Our performance, relatively, is likely to be better in a bear market than in a bull market so that deductions made from the above results should be tempered by the fact that it was the type of year when we should have done relatively well. In a year when the general market had a substantial advance I would be well satisfied to match the advance of the Averages.

从某种程度上来说，我们在1957年超出市场平均收益的表现是因为股市上大部分股票表现的比较差。相对来说，我们在熊市的表现很可能会比在牛市的时候要好，考虑到这个前提，上述投资收益并不值得夸耀，因为今年本就是我们应当取得较好收益的典型年份。当某一年市场整体表现相当好时，能够与之持平我就很满意了。

I can definitely say that our portfolio represents better value at the end of 1957 than it did at the end of 1956. This is due to both generally lower prices and the fact that we have had more time to acquire the more substantially undervalued securities which can only be acquired with patience. Earlier I mentioned our largest position which comprised 10% to 20% of the assets of the various partnerships. In time I plan to have this represent 20% of the assets of all partnerships but this cannot be hurried. Obviously during any acquisition period, our primary interest is to have the stock do nothing or decline rather than advance. Therefore, at any given time, a fair proportion of our portfolio may be in the sterile stage. This policy, while requiring patience, should maximize long term profits.

我可以很肯定的说我们的投资组合在1957年底的价值比1956年底要好。这既归功于整个市场的低价也归功于我们有足够的时间来获取这些只能耐心等待才能获取的低估证券。之前我提到过我们最大的一项投资占有我们所有合伙基金的10%-20%。我计划将我们所有合伙基金的20%投资到这个项目中，但不能着急。很显然，在任何建仓期，我们最大的利好是股价持平或是降低而不是上升。所以，在相当长时间内，我们投资组合中的相当一部分可能会没有收益。唯有耐心，这种策略才能使长期收益最大化。

I have tried to cover points which I felt might be of interest and disclose as much of our philosophy as may be imparted without talking of individual issues. If there are any questions concerning any phase of the operation, I would welcome hearing from you.

我试图表述我认为所应当表述的内容并披露我们的投资理念，同时不涉及具体的个案。如果你对于我们的运作有任何的疑问，请随时联系我。
