BUFFETT PARTNERSHIP. LTD. 

610 KIEWIT PLAZA 

OMAHA, NEBRASKA 68131 

TELEPHONE 042-4110

February 25th, 1970

To My Partners:

致我的合伙人：

This letter will attempt to provide a very elementary education regarding tax-exempt bonds with emphasis on the types and maturities of bonds which we expect to help partners in purchasing next month. If you expect to use our help in the purchase of bonds, it is important that you carefully read (and, if necessary , reread) this letter as it will serve as background for the specific purchases I suggest. If you disagree with me as to conclusions regarding types of bonds or maturities (and you would have been right and I would have been wrong if you had disagreed with me on the latter point either one or two years ago), you may well be correct, but we cannot be of assistance to you in the purchase of bonds outside our area. We will simply have our hands full concentrating in our recommended area, so will be unavailable to assist or advise in the purchase of convertible bonds, corporate bonds or short term issues.

这封信试图提供有关免税债券的基础教育，重点在于债券的类型和期限，我们希望这些能够为合伙人下个月购买债券提供帮助。如果你希望我们协助购买债券，请务必仔细阅读（如有必要，请重读）这封信，因为它是我所建议的具体购买行为的背景资料。如果你不同意我对债券类型或期限的结论（如果你在一两年前不同意我对债券期限的看法，你将是对的而我是错的），你可能是正确的，但我们无法帮你购买我们能力圈以外的债券。我们将全力专注于我们推荐的领域，因此无法在购买可转换债券、公司债券或短期债券方面提供帮助和建议。

I have tried to boil this letter down as much as possible. Some of it will be a little weighty - some a little over- simplified. I apologize for the shortcomings in advance. I have a feeling I am trying to put all the meat of a 100 page book in 10 pages - and have it read like the funny papers.

我会尽力写好这封信，但有些内容会略显繁重，有些则会过于简化。不足之处，敬请海涵。我感觉我正试图把一百页的内容全部塞到十张纸上，并且还想让它读起来很有趣。

I am sure you understand that our aid in the purchase of bonds will involve no future assistance regarding either these specific bonds or general investment decisions. I want to be available at this time to be of help because of the unusual amount of cash you have received in one distribution from us. I have no desire to be in the investment counseling business, directly or indirectly, and will not be available for discussion of financial matters after March 31st.

我相信你们明白，我们在购买债券方面的这类帮助未来不会再有，不管是这些具体的债券还是其他的投资决策。我想在这时候提供帮助，是因为你们刚刚收到了我们合伙公司解散时分配的大量现金。我无意直接或间接从事投资咨询业务，3月31日之后也不再会跟你们讨论任何财务方面的事务。

# The mechanics of Tax-Free Bonds. 免税债券的机制

For those who wish our help, we will arrange the purchase of bonds directly from municipal bond dealers throughout the country and have them confirm sale of the bonds directly to you. The confirmation should be saved as a basic document for tax purposes. You should not send a check to the bond dealer since he will deliver the bonds to your bank, along with a draft which the bank will pay by charging your account with them. In the case of bonds purchased in the secondary market (issues already outstanding), this settlement date will usually be about a week after confirmation date whereas, on new issues, the settlement date may be as much as a month later. The settlement date is shown plainly on the confirmation ticket (in the case of new issues this will be the second and final ticket rather than the preliminary "when issued" ticket), and you should have the funds at your bank ready to pay for the bonds on the settlement date. If you presently own Treasury Bills, they can be sold on a couple of days notice by your bank upon your instructions, so you should experience no problems in having the money available on time. Interest begins to accrue to you on the settlement date, even if the bond dealer is late in getting them delivered to your bank.

对于希望我们提供帮助的人，我们将安排你们直接从全国各地的市政债券交易商手中购买债券，并让他们直接销售给你们。债券确认票据应作为基本文件保存，以备纳税之用。你不需要把支票寄给债券交易商，因为他们会将债券连同汇票一起交给银行，银行会直接从你的账户中扣款。如果是在二级市场购买的债券（已发行的债券），交割日期通常在确认日期后一周左右，而新发行的债券，交割日期可能要晚一个月。交割日期已经很明显地标示在确认票据上了（如果是新发行的债券，则是第二张也是最后一张票据，而不是第一张“何时发行”的票据），你应该在银行账户中准备充足的资金，以便在交割日支付。如果你目前拥有国库券，银行可以根据你的指示提前几天通知你出售国库券，因此你在及时筹集资金方面应该没有问题。即使债券交易商将债券交付给银行的时间较晚，利息也将从交割日开始计算。

Bonds will be delivered in negotiable form (so-called "bearer" form which makes them like currency) with coupons attached. Usually the bonds are in $5,000 denominations and frequently they can be exchanged for registered bonds (sometimes at considerable expense and sometimes free - it depends upon the terms). Bonds in registered form are nonnegotiable without assignment by you, since you are the registered owner on the Transfer Agent's books. Bonds trade almost exclusively on a bearer basis and it is virtually impossible to sell registered bonds without converting them back into bearer form. Thus, unless you are going to own great physical quantities of bonds. I recommend keeping bonds in bearer form. This means keeping them in a very safe place and clipping the coupons every six months. Such coupons, when clipped, can be deposited in your bank account just like checks. If you have $250,000 in bonds, this probably means about fifty separate pieces of paper ($5,000 denominations) and perhaps six or eight trips a year to the safe deposit section to cut and deposit coupons.

债券将以可转让形式（所谓的“不记名”形式，与货币类似）交付，并附有息票。债券面值一般为5,000美元，通常可以兑换成记名债券（有时候费用高昂，有时候免费，这取决于它们的条款）。记名债券如果没有你的转让证书则无法转让，因为你是过户代理账簿上的登记所有人。债券几乎均以不记名方式进行交易，记名债券如果不转换成不记名债券，就很难卖掉。因此，除非你打算拥有大量的实体债券，否则我建议你使用不记名债券。不过这意味着要把它们放在一个非常安全的地方，并且每半年剪一次息票。剪下的这些息票可以像支票一样存入你的银行账户。如果你投资了250,000美元，也就是有50张债券（面额为5,000美元），这就意味着为了剪下息票并存入银行，你每年可能要去保险箱保管处六到八次。

It is also possible to open a custody account with a bank where, for a fairly nominal cost, they will keep the bonds, collect the interest and preserve your records for you. For example, a bank will probably perform the custodial service for you for about $200 a year on a $250,000 portfolio. If you are interested in a custodial account, you should talk to a Trust Officer at your commercial bank as to the nature of their services and cost. Otherwise, you should have a safe deposit box.

你们也可以在银行开设一个托管账户，只需支付相当低的费用，他们就可以为你保管债券、收取利息并为你保存你的记录。例如，对于一个25万美元的投资组合，大概只需要花费200美元，银行就会为你提供一年的托管服务。如果你对托管账户感兴趣，你应该向商业银行的信托人员去咨询他们的服务和费用。否则，你应该拥有一个保险箱。

# Taxation 税收

The interest received upon the deposit of coupons from tax-free bonds is, of course, free from Federal Income Taxes. This means if you are at a 30% top Federal Income Tax bracket, a 6% return from tax-free bonds is equivalent to about 8-1/2% from taxable bonds. Thus, for most of our partners, excluding minors or some retired people, tax-free bonds will be more attractive than taxable bonds. For people with little or no income from wages or dividends, but with substantial capital, it is possible that a combination of taxable bonds (to bring taxable income up to about the 25% or 30% bracket) plus tax-free bonds will bring the highest total after-tax income. Where appropriate, we will work with you to achieve such a balance.

从免税债券中获得的息票利息是免征联邦所得税的。这意味着，如果你是处于联邦所得税最高级别30%税率范围内的纳税人，免税债券6%的回报率相当于应税债券约8.5%的回报率。因此，除了未成年人或部分退休人员之外，对于我们的大多数合伙人来说，免税债券比应税债券更具吸引力。对于工资或红利收入很少或没有，但拥有大量资本的人来说，将应税债券（使应税收入达到25%或30%左右）与免税债券相结合，可能会带来最高的税后总收入。如果可以，我们将与你一起努力打造这种组合。

The situation in respect to State Income Taxes is more complicated. In Nebraska. where the State Income Tax is computed as a percentage of the Federal Income Tax, the effect is that there is no state tax on interest from tax-free bonds. My understanding of both the New York and California law is that tax-free bonds of entities within the home state are not subject to State Income Tax, but tax-free bonds from other states are subject to the local State Income Tax. I also believe that the New York City Income Tax exempts tax-free bonds of entities based within the State of New York, but taxes those from other states. I am no expert on state income taxes and make no attempt to post myself on changes taking place within the various states or cities. Therefore, I defer to your local tax advisor, but simply mention these few general impressions so that you will be alert to the existence of a potential problem. In Nebraska there is no need to have any local considerations enter into the after-tax calculation. Where out-of-state issues are subject to local taxation, the effective cost of your State or Municipal Income Tax is reduced by the benefit received from deducting it on your Federal Income Tax return. This, of course, varies with the individual. Additionally, in some states there are various taxes on intangible property which may apply to all tax-free bonds or just those of out-of-state entities. There are none of these in Nebraska, but I cannot advise on the other states.

州所得税的情况更为复杂。在内布拉斯加州，州所得税按联邦所得税的一定比例计算，因此免税债券的利息不需要缴纳州税。我对纽约州和加州法律的理解是，本州的免税债券无需缴纳州所得税，但其他州的免税债券则需要在本州缴纳州所得税。我还认为，纽约市所得税对纽约州的免税债券免税，但对其他州的免税债券征税。我不是州所得税方面的专家，也不想对各州或各市的征税情况发表自己的看法。因此，我建议你向当地的税务顾问咨询。我只是简单概要地提一下，以便你对可能存在的问题保持警惕。在内布拉斯加州，税后计算无需考虑任何本地因素。如果州外所得需缴纳地方税，则你的州或市所得税的实际成本将会减少，因为这些可以在联邦所得税中扣除。当然，这因人而异。此外，有些州对无形财产征收各类税，这些税可能适用于所有免税债券，也可能仅适用于州外的债券。内布拉斯加州不征收这些税，但我无法为其他州提供建议。

When bonds are bought at a discount from par and later are sold or mature (come due and get paid), the difference between the proceeds and cost is subject to capital gain or loss treatment. (There are minor exceptions to this statement as, unfortunately, there are to most general statements on investments and taxes but they will be pointed out to you should they affect any securities we recommend). This reduces the net after-tax yield by a factor involving the general rate of future capital gains taxes and the specific future tax position of the individual. Later on, we will discuss the impact of such capital gains taxes in calculating the relative attractiveness of discount bonds versus "full coupon" bonds.

债券以低于面值的折扣价买入，之后出售或到期（并偿付），收益与成本之间的差额须进行资本损益处理。（不幸的是，大多数关于投资和税收的一般性声明都有小的例外情况，这个也是，但如果这些例外情况影响到我们推荐的任何证券，我们会向你指出）。这就降低了税后净收益率，不过这要取决于未来资本利得税的一般税率和个人未来的具体纳税情况。稍后，在比较贴现债券与“全息”债券时，我们将讨论这种资本利得税的影响。

Finally, one most important point. Although the law is not completely clear, you should probably not contemplate owning tax-free bonds if you have, or expect to have, general purpose bank or other indebtedness.

最后，还有最重要的一点。虽然不清楚法律的详细规定，但如果你拥有或预期会拥有银行贷款或其他债务，你最好不要购买免税债券。

The law excludes the deductibility of interest on loans incurred or continued to purchase or carry tax-free bonds, and the interpretation of this statute will probably tend to be broadened as the years pass. For example, my impression is that you have no problem if you have a mortgage against real property (unless the debt was incurred in order to acquire municipal bonds) in deducting the mortgage interest on your Federal Tax return, even though you own tax-free bonds at the same time. However, I believe that if you have a general bank loan, even though the proceeds were directly used to purchase stocks, a handball court, etc. and the tax-free bonds are not used for security for the loan, you are asking for trouble if you deduct the interest and, at the same time, are the owner of tax-free bonds. Therefore, I would pay off bank loans before owning tax-free bonds, but I leave detailed examination of this question to you and your tax advisor. I merely mention it to make you aware of the potential problem.

如果贷款目的是为了购买和持有免税债券，法律规定由此产生和继续产生的贷款利息在计算税额时不予扣除，而且随着时间的推移，对这一法规的解释可能会趋于扩大化。例如，在我的印象中，如果你有不动产抵押贷款（除非该债务是为了购买市政债券而产生的），那么即使你同时拥有免税债券，你也可以在联邦税中扣除抵押贷款利息。但是我认为，如果你有一笔普通银行贷款，即使所得款项直接用于购买股票、手球场等，而且免税债券也没有用于贷款担保，但是如果你在拥有免税债券的同时还在纳税时扣除贷款利息，你就是自找麻烦。因此，我会先还清银行贷款，然后再拥有免税债券，但这个问题的详细研究还是留给你和你的税务顾问吧。我提到这个只是为了让你意识到可能存在的问题。

# Marketability 市场化

Tax-free bonds are materially different from common stocks or corporate bonds in that there are literally hundreds of thousands of issues, with the great majority having very few holders. This substantially inhibits the development of close, active markets. Whenever the City of New York or Philadelphia wants to raise money it sells perhaps twenty, thirty or forty non-identical securities, since it will offer an issue with that many different maturities. A 6% bond of New York coming due in 1980 is a different animal from a 6% bond of New York coming due in 1981. One cannot be exchanged for the other, and a seller has to find a buyer for the specific item he holds. When you consider that New York may offer bonds several times a year, it is easy to see why just this one city may have somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 issues outstanding. Grand Island, Nebraska may have 75 issues outstanding. The average amount of each issue might be $100,000 and the average number of holders may be six or eight per issue. Thus, it is absolutely impossible to have quoted markets at all times for all issues and spreads between bids and offers may be very wide. You can't set forth in the morning to buy a specific Grand Island issue of your choosing. It may not be offered at any price, anywhere, and if you do find one seller, there is no reason why he has to be realistic compared to other offerings of similar quality. On the other hand, there are single issues such as those of the Ohio Turnpike, Illinois Turnpike, etc. that amount to $200 million or more and have thousands of bondholders owning a single entirely homogeneous and interchangeable issue. Obviously, here you get a high degree of marketability.

免税债券与普通股票和公司债券有本质区别，免税债券的种类有数十万，但每一种的持有者很多时候却寥寥无几。这在很大程度上阻碍了集中且活跃的交易市场的建立。当纽约市或费城想要筹集资金时，由于期限不同，它们可能会发行二三十种甚至四十种不尽相同的债券。1980年到期的6%的纽约市债券与1981年到期的6%的纽约市债券是不同的。两者不能互换，卖方必须为其持有的某种债券单独寻找买方。纽约市每年可能多次发行债券，这就不难理解为什么仅这一个城市就可能有大约1000期发行在外的债券。内布拉斯加州的格兰德岛大概有75期发行在外的债券。每期债券的平均金额可能是10万美元，平均持有者可能只有6到8个。因此，这些债券不可能在任何时候都有报价市场，买卖价差可能非常大。你不可能在早上设定好一个价格去购买格兰德岛发行的某个债券。它可能不会在任何地方以任何价格出售。即使你找到了一个卖家，也没有理由让他去跟其他类似债券的售价做比较。不过也有例外，例如俄亥俄州收费公路、伊利诺伊州收费公路等债券，它们只发行过一次、完全同质且可互换、发行量不低于2亿美元、有成千上万的持有者。显然，这种债券的市场化程度会很高。

My impression is that marketability is generally a function of the following three items, in descending order of importance: (1) the size of the particular issue; (2) the size of the issuer (a $100,000 issue of the State of Ohio will be more marketable than a $100,000 issue of Podunk, Ohio); and (3) the quality of the issuer. By far the most sales effort goes into the selling of new issues of bonds. An average of over $200 million per week of new issues comes up for sale, and the machinery of bond distribution is geared to get them sold, large or small. In my opinion, there is frequently insufficient differential in yield at time of issue for the marketability differences that will exist once the initial sales push is terminated. We have frequently run into markets in bonds where the spread between bid and asked prices may get to 15%. There is no need to buy bonds with the potential for such grotesque markets (although the profit spread to the dealer who originally offers them is frequently wider than on more marketable bonds) and we will not be buying them for you. The bonds we expect to buy will usually tend to have spreads (reflecting the difference between what you would pay net for such bonds on purchase and receive net on sale at the same point in time) of from 2% to 5%. Such a spread would be devastating if you attempted to trade in such bonds, but I don't believe it should be a deterrent for a long-term investor. The real necessity is to stay away from bonds of very limited marketability - which frequently are the type local bond dealers have the greatest monetary incentive to push.

我认为市场化一般是由以下三项因素决定的，重要性依次递减：（1）特定债券的发行量；（2）发行人的规模（俄亥俄州发行的10万美元债券就比俄亥俄州波敦克发行的10万美元债券更具市场化）；（3）发行人的质量。迄今为止，新发行债券的销售力度最大。平均每周有超过2亿美元的新发行债券待售，而债券分销机制的目的就是无论发行量是多少，都要将这些债券卖光。在我看来，债券发行时的收益率差异，往往不足以消除初次发行销售导致的市场化差异。我们经常在债券市场上遇到买卖价差高达15%的情况。我们没有必要去购买可能会出现这种荒唐市场状况的债券（尽管与更具市场化的债券相比，这些债券首次发行后的卖方利润通常更大），我们也不会为你购买这些债券。我们希望购买的债券的价差通常在2%至5%之间（这反映你在购买时支付的净价与在同一时间出售时获得的净价之间的差额）。如果你试图频繁交易此类债券，这样的价差将是毁灭性的，但我认为这不应该成为长期投资者的障碍。不过必须要远离市场化程度过低的债券——本地债券交易商往往有来自金钱方面的最大刺激去推销这类债券。

# Specific Areas of Purchase  具体购买范围

We will probably concentrate our purchases in the following general areas:

我们可能会将购买范围集中在以下领域：

(1) Large revenue-producing public entities such as toll roads, electric power districts, water districts, etc. Many of these issues possess high marketability, are subject to quantitative analysis, and sometimes have favorable sinking fund or other factors which tend not to receive full valuation in the market place.

（1）大型盈利性实体，如收费公路、水电企业等。这类债券大都具有很高的市场化，可以进行定量分析，有时还会因为偿债基金或其他因素导致市场价格低于内在价值。

(2) Industrial Development Authority bonds which arise when a public entity holds title to property leased to a private corporation. For example, Lorain, Ohio holds title to an $80 million project for U.S. Steel Corp. The Development Authority Board issued bonds to pay for the project and has executed a net and absolute lease with U.S. Steel to cover the bond payments. The credit of the city or state is not behind the bonds and they are only as good as the company that is on the lease. Many top-grade corporations stand behind an aggregate of several billion dollars of these obligations, although new ones are being issued only in small amounts ($5 million per project or less) because of changes in the tax laws. For a period of time there was a very substantial prejudice against such issues, causing them to sell at yields considerably higher than those commensurate with their inherent credit standing. This prejudice has tended to diminish, reducing the premium yields available, but I still consider it a most attractive field. Our insurance company owns a majority of its bonds in this category.

（2）工业发展局债券，一般产生于公共实体的资产租赁给私人公司时。例如，俄亥俄州洛雷恩市拥有一项价值8000万美元的项目，租赁给美国钢铁公司使用。发展局董事会发行债券购买该项目，然后执行与美国钢铁公司的租约，并以租赁所得来偿付所发行的债券。这种债券背后并没有城市或州政府的信用，只有承租公司的信用。尽管由于税法的改变，导致新债券的发行量变得较小（每个项目500万美元或更少），但许多顶级公司在这类债券上的债务总额高达数十亿美元。在一段时期内，人们对这类债券有很大的偏见，导致它们销售时的收益率大大高于与其内在信用等级相称的收益率。这种偏见有逐渐减少的趋势，从而降低了可获得的溢价收益，但我仍然认为这是最具吸引力的一个领域。我们保险公司的大部分债券都属于这一类。

(3) Public Housing Authority Issues for those of you who wish the very highest grade of tax-free bonds. In effect, these bonds bear the guarantee of the U.S. Government, so they are all rated AAA. In states where local taxes put a premium on buying in-state issues, and I can’t fill your needs from (1) and (2) , my tendency would be to put you into Housing Authority issues rather than try to select from among credits that I don't understand. If you direct me to buy obligations of your home state, you should expect substantial quantities of Housing Authority issues. There is no need to diversify among such issues, as they all represent the top credit available.

（3）公共住房管理局发行的债券，主要针对那些希望获得最高级别免税债券的人。实际上，这些债券都有美国政府的担保，因此都被评为AAA级。在一些州，地方税对购买州内发行的债券有额外补贴，而我又无法在（1）和（2）中满足你们的需求，所以我倾向于让你购买住房管理局发行的债券，而不想推荐我不了解的东西。如果你让我帮你购买你所在州的债券，这种债券会占很大比例。但是没必要进行分散投资，因为它们都拥有最高信用等级。

(4) State obligations of a direct or indirect nature.

直接或间接性的州义务。

You will notice I am not buying issues of large cities. I don't have the faintest idea how to analyze a New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, etc. (a friend mentioned the other day when Newark was trying to sell bonds at a very fancy rate that the Mafia was getting very upset because Newark was giving them a bad name). Your analysis of a New York City - and I admit it is hard to imagine them not paying their bills for any extended period of time - would be as good as mine. My approach to bonds is pretty much like my approach to stocks. If I can't understand something, I tend to forget it. Passing an opportunity which I don't understand - even if someone else is perceptive enough to analyze it and get paid well for doing it - doesn't bother me. All I want to be sure of is that I get paid well for the things I do feel capable of handling - and that I am right when I make affirmative decisions.

你会注意到我不买大城市发行的债券。因为我根本不知道如何分析纽约市、芝加哥、费城等城市的债券（前几天，一位朋友提到，当纽瓦克试图以非常优惠的利率发售债券时，黑手党非常不高兴，因为纽瓦克给他们带来了坏名声）。你对纽约市的分析或许和我的一样好——我承认很难想象他们会长期无法支付账单。我对债券的态度就像我对股票的态度一样。如果不能理解，我就会跳过。对于我不了解的机会，即使别人有足够的洞察力来分析它，并因此获得很好的收益，我也不会在意。我想要的是从我能够掌控的投资中获取好收益，在这些投资上做出购买决定时我就已经知道自己是正确的了。

We will probably tend to purchase somewhere between five and ten issues for most of you. However, if you wish to limit me to your home state, it may be fewer issues - and perhaps those will only be Housing Authorities. We will try not to buy in smaller than $25,000 pieces and will prefer larger amounts where appropriate. Smaller lots of bonds are usually penalized upon resale, sometimes substantially. The bond salesman doesn't usually explain this to you when you buy the $10,000 of bonds from him, but it gets explained when you later try to sell the $10,000 to him. We may make exceptions where we are buying secondary market issues in smaller pieces - but only if we are getting an especially good price on the buy side because of the small size of the offering.

我们可能会为你们大多数人购买五到十个债券。但是，如果你希望将购买范围限制在你所在的州，那么购买的数量可能会更少——而且可能只能购买住房管理局发行的债券。我们建议用于购买债券的资金至少达25,000美元，如果可能，金额大些更好。较小数量的债券在转售时通常会打折，有时折扣甚至会很大。当你向债券销售员购买10,000美元的债券时，他通常不会向你解释这一点，但当你后来想把这10,000美元的债券卖给他时，他就会“好好地”向你解释了。偶尔我们也会不按常理在二级市场上购买数量较少的债券，但前提是由于数量少我们能得到特别优惠的价格。

# Callable Bonds 可赎回债券

We will not buy bonds where the issuer of the bonds has a right to call (retire) the bonds on a basis which substantially loads the contract in his favor. It is amazing to me to see people buy bonds which are due in forty years, but where the issuer has the right to call the bonds at a tiny premium in five or ten years. Such a contract essentially means that you have made a forty year deal if it is advantageous to the issuer (and disadvantageous to you) and a five year deal if the initial contract turns out to be advantageous to you (and disadvantageous to the issuer). Such contracts are really outrageous and exist because bond investors can't think through the implications of such a contract form and bond dealers don't insist on better terms for their customers. One extremely interesting fact is that bonds with very unattractive call features sell at virtually the same yield as otherwise identical bonds which are noncallable.

我们不会购买债券发行人有权赎回（清偿）的债券，因为这样的债券条款大大有利于发行人。我很惊讶地看到有人会购买四十年后到期的债券，但发行人却有权在五或十年后以极少的溢价赎回。这种条款实质上意味着，如果对发行人有利（而对你不利），你就做了一笔四十年的交易；如果对你有利（而对发行人不利），你就只能做一笔五年的交易。这种合同实在是太离谱了。之所以存在，是因为债券投资者无法看清这些条款的实质，而债券交易商也没有坚持为客户提供更好的条款。一个非常有趣的事实是，非常不具吸引力的可赎回债券与其他相同的不可赎回债券的利率几乎一样。

It should be pointed out that most Nebraska bonds carry highly unfair call provisions. Despite this severe contractual disadvantage, they do not offer higher yields than bonds with more equitable terms.

需要指出的是，大多数内布拉斯加债券都有极不公平的赎回条款。尽管有这种巨大劣势，但它们的收益率并不比条款更公平的债券要高。

One way to avoid this problem is to buy bonds which are totally noncallable. Another way is to buy discount bonds where the right of the issuer to call the bond is at a price so far above your cost as to render the possible call inconsequential. If you buy a bond at 60 which is callable at 103, the effective cost to you of granting the issuer the right to prematurely terminate the contract (which is a right you never have) is insignificant. But to buy a bond of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power at 100 to come due at 100 in 1999 or to come due at 104 in 1974, depending on which is to the advantage of the issuer and to your disadvantage, is the height of foolishness when comparable yields are available on similar credits without such an unfair contract. Nevertheless, just such a bond was issued in October, 1969 and similar bonds continue to be issued every day. I only write at such length about an obvious point, since it is apparent from the continual sale of such bonds that many investors haven't the faintest notion how this loads the dice against them and many bond salesmen aren't about to tell them.

避免这一问题的方法之一是只购买不可赎回的债券。另一种方法是购买贴现债券，发行人有权赎回债券的价格远远高于你的成本，从而使可能的赎回变得无关紧要。如果你以60美元购买了一张可以在103美元赎回的债券，那么你给予发行人提前终止合同的权利（这是你永远不会拥有的权利）的实际成本是微不足道的。但是，以100美元购买洛杉矶水电部门的可赎回债券，可能会在1999年以100美元的价格到期，也可能会在1974年以104美元的价格提前被赎回，这取决于哪种情况对发行人有利而对你不利。如果你能够在没有这种条款的债券中获得类似的收益，购买这种可赎回债券会让你看起来愚蠢至极。1969年10月就刚好发行了这样的债券，而且类似的债券每天都在发行。我之所以用这么大的篇幅来论述这一显而易见的问题，是因为从这种债券的持续销售中可以看出，许多投资者根本不知道这种债券对他们多么不利，而许多债券销售员也不打算告诉他们。

# Maturity and the Mathematics of Bonds债券的期限与数学计算

Many people, in buying bonds, select maturities based on how long they think they are going to want to hold bonds, how long they are going to live, etc. While this is not a silly approach, it is not necessarily the most logical. The primary determinants in selection of maturity should probably be (1) the shape of the yield curve; (2) your expectations regarding future levels of interest rates and (3) the degree of quotational fluctuation you are willing to endure or hope to possibly profit from. Of course, (2) is the most important but by far the most difficult upon which to comment intelligently.

在购买债券时，很多人会根据他们想持有债券的时间长短、寿命长短等因素来选择债券的期限。虽然这种方法并不傻，但未必最符合逻辑。选择期限的主要决定因素应该是：（1）收益率曲线的形状；（2）对未来基准利率水平的预期；（3）你愿意忍受或希望从中获利的价格波动幅度。当然，（2）是最重要的，但也是到目前为止最难给出睿智评论的。

Let's tackle the yield curve first. When other aspects of quality are identical, there will be a difference in interest rates paid based upon the length of the bond being offered. For example, a top grade bond being offered now might have a yield of 4.75% if it came due in six or nine months, 5.00% in two years, 5.25% in five years, 5.50% in ten years and 6.25% in twenty years. When long rates are substantially higher than short rates, the curve is said to be strongly positive. In the U. S. Government bond market, rates recently have tended to produce a negative yield curve; that is, a long term Government bond over the last year or so has consistently yielded less than a short term one. Sometimes the yield curve has been very flat, and sometimes it is positive out to a given point, such as ten years, and then flattens out. What you should understand is that it varies, often very substantially, and that on an historical basis the present slope tends to be in the high positive range. This doesn't mean that long bonds are going to be worth more but it does mean that you are being paid more to extend maturity than in many periods. If yields remained constant for several years, you would do better with longer bonds than shorter bonds, regardless of how long you intended to hold them.

我们先来看看收益率曲线。在其他方面相同的情况下，根据发行期限长短，债券利率也会有所不同。例如，现在发行的最高评级的债券如果在6个月或9个月后到期，收益率可能是4.75%，两年后是5.00%，五年后是5.25%，十年后是5.50%，二十年后是6.25%。当长期利率大大高于短期利率时，该曲线被称为强正向曲线。最近美国国债的利率已经形成了反向曲线，也就是说，在过去一年左右的时间里，长期国债的收益率一直低于短期国债。有时候收益率曲线非常平缓，有时候在某一特定时间点，例如十年，收益率曲线为正，然后趋于平缓。你们应该明白的是，它的变化往往非常大，而且从历史上看，目前的曲线[^1]处于陡峭的正向范围内。这并不意味着长期债券会更值钱，但确实意味着与许多时期相比，把短期债券换成期限更长的债券收益会更高。如果债券收益率在数年内保持不变，那么无论你打算持有多久，长期债券都比短期债券好。

The second factor in determining maturity selection is expectations regarding future rate levels. Anyone who has done much predicting in this field has tended to look very foolish very fast. I did not regard rates as unattractive one year ago, and I was proved very wrong almost immediately. I believe present rates are not unattractive and I may look foolish again. Nevertheless, a decision has to be made and you can make just as great a mistake if you buy short term securities now and rates available on reinvestment in a few years are much lower.

决定期限选择的第二个因素是对未来基准利率水平的预期。对利率做出的预测越多就会越快地显示出这个人的愚蠢。一年前我认为利率比较有吸引力，但立刻被证明是大错特错。我如果又一次说目前的利率并非没有吸引力，可能会再次显得愚蠢。然而无论如何，即使犯了错，你也必须要做出一个投资决定。因为如果你现在购买短期债券，而几年后的基准利率更低，你也一样是犯了错。

The final factor involves your tolerance for quotational fluctuation. This involves the mathematics of bond investment and may be a little difficult for you to understand. Nevertheless, it is important that you get a general grasp of the principles. Let's assume for the moment a perfectly flat yield curve and a non-callable bond. Further assume present rates are 5% and that you buy two bonds, one due in two years and one due in twenty years. Now assume one year later that yields on new issues have gone to 3% and that you wish to sell your bonds. Forgetting about market spreads, commissions, etc. , you will receive $1,019.60 for the original two year $1,000 bond (now with one year to run) and $1,288.10 for the nineteen year bond (originally twenty years). At these prices, a purchaser will get exactly 3% on his money after amortizing the premium he has paid and cashing the stream of 5% coupons attached to each bond. It is a matter of indifference to him whether to buy your nineteen year 5% bond at $1,288.10 or a new 3% bond (which we have assumed is the rate current - one year later) at $1,000.00. On the other hand, let's assume rates went to 7%. Again we will ignore commissions, capital gains taxes on the discount, etc. Now the buyer will only pay $981.00 for the bond with one year remaining until maturity and $791.60 for the bond with nineteen years left. Since he can get 7% on new issues, he is only willing to buy your bond at a discount sufficient so that accrual of this discount will give him the same economic benefits from your 5% coupon that a 7% coupon at $1,000.00 would give him.

最后一个因素涉及你对价格波动的承受能力。这涉及债券投资的数学问题，对你们来说可能较难理解。尽管如此，你们还是应该大致掌握其中的原理。我们先以不可赎回债券为例，假设收益率曲线完全平坦。再假设现在的利率是5%，你购买了两张债券，一张两年后到期，一张二十年后到期。现在假设一年后新发行债券的收益率下降到3%，你希望出售债券。抛开市场利差、佣金等因素不谈，假如原来的两年期1,000美元债券（现在还有一年到期）的价格是1,019.60美元；19年期债券（原来是20年期）的价格是1,288.10美元。以这些价格计算，购买者在摊销所支付的溢价和兑现每张债券附带的5%的息票后，将获得3%的收益。对他来说，是以1288.10美元的价格购买19年期的5%债券，还是以1000.00美元的价格购买新的3%债券（我们假定这也是一年后的现行利率），两者是一样的[^2]。另一方面，假设利率上升到7%。我们将再次忽略佣金、折价的资本利得税等。现在，买方只需为一年后到期的债券支付981.00美元，为19年后到期的债券支付791.60美元。由于他可以从新发行的债券中获得7%的收益，所以他只愿意折价购买你的债券，这样他从你卖出的票面利率为5%的债券中所获得的收益，与以1,000美元面值价购买的7%票面利率的债券收益才会相同。

The principle is simple. The wider the swings in interest rates and the longer the bond, the more the value of a bond can go up or down on an interim basis before maturity. It should be pointed out in the first example where rates went to 3%, our long term bond would only have appreciated to about $1,070.00 if it had been callable in five years at par, although it would have gone down just as much if 7% rates had occurred. This just illustrates the inherent unfairness of call provisions.

原理很简单。利率波动的幅度越大，债券的期限越长，债券的价格在到期前的涨跌幅度就越大。应该指出的是，在第一个例子中，假如我们的长期债券可以在五年内按面值赎回，那么利率下降到3%，它的价值只会上升到大约1,070美元；利率上升到7%，它的价值也会下降的一样多。这就体现了赎回条款的内在不公平。

For over two decades, interest rates on tax-free bonds have almost continuously gone higher and buyers of long term bonds have continuously suffered. This does not mean it is bad now to buy long term bonds - it simply means that the illustration in the above paragraph has worked in only one direction for a long period of time and people are much more conscious of the downside risks from higher rates than the upside potential from lower ones.

二十多年来，基准利率几乎持续在走高，长期免税债券的购买者持续遭受损失。这并不意味着现在不适合购买长期债券——这只是说明，上一段所描述的状况，在很长一段时间内只朝着一个方向在走；人们更注重利率上升带来的债券价格下行风险，而非利率下降带来的上涨潜力。

If it is a 50-50 chance as to the future general level of interest rates and the yield curve is substantially positive, then the odds are better in buying long term non-callable bonds than shorter term ones. This reflects my current conclusion and, therefore, I intend to buy bonds within the ten to twenty-five year range. If you have any preferences within that range, we will try to select bonds reflecting such preferences, but if you are interested in shorter term bonds, we will not be able to help you as we are not searching out bonds in this area.

如果未来的基准利率涨跌概率对半开，而收益率曲线是大幅正向的，那么购买不可赎回的长期债券要好于短期债券。这就是我目前的结论，因此我打算购买10至25年期的债券。如果你对这一期限范围内的债券感兴趣，我们会尽量协助；但如果你只对短期债券感兴趣，我们将无法提供帮助，因为我们并没有在这一领域搜寻债券。

Before you decide to buy a twenty year bond, go back and read the paragraph showing how prices change based upon changes in interest rates. Of course, if you hold the bond straight through, you are going to get the contracted rate of interest, but if you sell earlier, you are going to be subject to the mathematical forces described in that paragraph, for better or for worse. Bond prices also change because of changes in quality over the years but, in the tax-free area, this has tended to be - and probably will continue to be - a relatively minor factor compared to the impact of changes in the general structure of interest rates.

在你决定购买20年期债券之前，请回过头来阅读关于债券价格如何随基准利率变化而变化的段落。当然，如果你一直持有该债券，你将获得债券条款规定的利率；但如果你提前卖出，你将受到该段描述的数学力量或好或坏的影响。多年来，债券价格也会因质量变化而变化，但在免税债券领域，与基准利率的影响相比，这往往是一个相对次要的因素，而且很可能会继续如此。

# Discount Versus Full Coupon Bonds 贴现债券与全息债券

You will have noticed in the above discussion that if you now wanted to buy a 7% return on a nineteen year bond, you had a choice between buying a new nineteen year bond with a 7% coupon rate or buying a bond with a 5% coupon at $791.60, which would pay you $1,000.00 in nineteen years. Either purchase would have yielded exactly 7% compounded semi-annually to you. Mathematically, they are the same. In the case of tax-free bonds the equation is complicated, however, by the fact that the $70.00 coupon is entirely tax-free to you, whereas the bond purchased at a discount gives you tax-free income of $50.00 per year but a capital gain at the end of the nineteenth year of $208.40. Under the present tax law, you would owe anything from a nominal tax, if the gain from realization of the discount was your only taxable income in the nineteenth year, up to a tax of over $70.00 if it came on top of very large amounts of capital gain at that time (the new tax law provides for capital gain rates of 35%, and even slightly higher on an indirect basis in 1972 and thereafter for those realizing very large gains.) In addition to this, you might have some state taxes to pay on the capital gain.

从上面的讨论中你会注意到，如果你现在想购买收益率为7%的19年期债券，你可以选择按面值购买票面利率为7%的新的19年期债券，或者以791.60美元的价格购买面值为1000美元、票面利率为5%的债券。无论购买哪种债券，按每半年进行复利计算，年收益率都是7%。从数学上讲，它们是一样的。然而，对于免税债券来说，方程就变得复杂了，因为70美元的息票对你来说是完全免税的，而折价购买的债券每年只能给你带来50美元的免税收入，但在第19年年底会给你带来208.40美元的资本收益。根据现行税法，如果折价收益是你在第19年的唯一应税收入，你只需缴纳很少的税款；但如果这个折价收益是你当时的巨额资本利得中的一部分（新税法规定资本利得税率为35%，1972年及之后实现的巨额收益的间接税率甚至还要高一些），你则需缴纳70多美元的税款。除此之外，你还可能需要为资本利得缴纳一些州税。

Obviously, under these circumstances you are not going to pay the $791.60 for the 5% coupon and feel you are equally as well off as with the 7% coupon at $1,000.00. Neither is anyone else. Therefore, identical quality securities with identical maturities sell at considerably higher gross yields when they have low coupons and are priced at discounts than if they bear current high coupons.

显然在这种情况下，你不会为5%票面利息的债券支付791.60美元，并觉得自己的收益和按1,000美元面值购买的7%票面利息的债券一样。其他人也不会。因此，质量相同、期限相同的债券，与高票面利率的相比，票面利率低、实际利率高的债券的折价会更大。

Interestingly enough, for most taxpayers, such higher gross yields over-compensate for the probable tax to be paid. This is due to several factors. First, no one knows what the tax law will be when the bonds mature and it is both natural and probably correct to assume the tax rate will be stiffer at that time than now. Second, even though a 5% coupon on a $1,000.00 bond purchased at $791.60 due in nineteen years is the equivalent of a 7% coupon on a $1,000.00 bond purchased at par with the same maturity, people prefer to get the higher current return in their pocket. The owner of the 5% coupon bond is only getting around 6.3% current yield on his $791.60 with the balance necessary to get him up to 7% coming from the extra $208.40 he picks up at the end. Finally, the most important factor affecting prices currently on discount bonds (and which will keep affecting them) is that banks have been taken out of the market as buyers of discount tax-free bonds by changes brought about in bank tax treatment through the 1969 Tax Reform Act. Banks have historically been the largest purchasers and owners of tax-free bonds and anything that precludes them from one segment of the market has dramatic effects on the supply-demand situation in that segment. This may tend to give some edge to individuals in the discount tax-free market, particularly those who are not likely to be in a high tax bracket when the bonds mature or are sold.

有趣的是，由于对大多数纳税人来说，折价购买实际利率更高的债券，即使到期时可能需要缴纳税款，税后收益率也会更高。这是由几个因素造成的。首先，没有人知道债券到期时的税法会如何变化，假定届时的税率会比现在高是很自然、也很正确的事。其次，尽管以791.60美元购买19年后到期的面值为1000美元票面利息为5%的债券，等价于以面值购买相同期限的面值为1000美元票面利息为7%的债券，但人们更愿意将更高的当期回报收入囊中。持有票面利息为5%的债券的人只能从他的791.60美元中获得约6.3%的当前收益率，而使他的收益率达到7%所需的余额则来自于他到期时可以额外获得的208.40美元。最后，目前影响贴现债券价格的最重要因素（而且将继续影响价格）是1969年《税制改革法案》对银行税收待遇的变更，使银行不再是免税贴现债券的买家。银行历来是免税债券的最大购买者和所有者，任何将银行排除在市场之外的行为都会对该市场的供求状况产生巨大影响。这可能会使个人在免税贴现债券市场上获得一些优势，尤其是那些在债券到期或出售时不会处于高税率等级的人。

If I can get a significantly higher effective after-tax yield (allowing for sensible estimates of your particular future tax rate possibilities), I intend to purchase discount bonds for you. I know some partners prefer full coupon bonds, even though their effective yield is less, since they prefer to maximize the current cash yield and if they will so advise me, we will stick to full coupon issues (or very close thereto) in their cases.

如果能获得更高的实际税后收益率（考虑到对你未来特定税率可能性的合理估计），我打算为你们购买贴现债券。我知道有些合伙人喜欢全息债券，即使它们的实际收益率较低，因为他们更希望最大限度地提高当前的现金回报率。如果他们以此咨询我，我将会按照他们的要求只购买全息债券（或与此类似的债券）。

# Procedure 程序

I intend to be in the office solidly through March (including every Saturday except March 7th) and will be glad to see any partner or talk with him by phone. To aid in scheduling, please make an appointment with Gladys (or me). The only request I make is that you absorb as much as possible of this letter before we talk. As you can see, it would be an enormous problem if I had to explain each item to all of you.

我整个三月都会在办公室（包括除3月7日以外的每个周六），我很乐意与任何合作伙伴会面或通过电话交谈。为了便于安排，请与Gladys（或我）预约。我唯一的要求是，在我们交谈之前，请你尽可能多地吸收这封信的内容。正如你们所看到的，如果我必须向每个人解释每一项内容，将会非常麻烦。

If you decide you want us to help you in buying bonds, you should let us know:

如果你们已经决定要我们帮助购买债券，你们应该让我们知道：

(1)  Whether you want to restrict purchases to your home state for local tax reasons;

（1）出于地方税的考虑，你是否希望只在本州购买债券；

(2)  Whether you want to restrict us to full coupon issues or let us use our judgment as to where you get the best value;

（2）你希望我们仅限于全息债券，还是让我们根据自己的判断为你提供最有利的债券；

(3)  Your preference as to maturity in the ten to twenty-five year range or if you prefer to let us use our judgment in that area;

（3）你希望购买10至25年期的债券，还是让我们在这方面作出判断；

(4)  How much you want to invest - we may end up several percent short of the figure you name, but we will never go over;

（4）你希望投资多少——最终我们可能会比你指定的数字少几个百分点，但绝不会超出；

(5)  On what bank the bonds should be drafted.

（5）通过哪家银行处理用于购买债券的汇票。

We will advise you by phone or letter as we buy bonds. Bill and John will be doing much of the mechanical work. Needless to say, none of us will have any financial interest in any transaction. Should you have any questions regarding the mechanics, please direct them to John or Bill as I will probably be swamped and they will be more familiar with specific transactions. After March 31st, I don't expect to be around the office for several months. Therefore, if you want to talk things over, come in by then. The completion of all purchases may go into April, but Bill will be taking care of this and the mechanics will all be set up.

我们在购买债券时会通过电话或信件与你沟通。Bill和John将负责大部分程序方面的工作。我们当然不会在任何交易中获取任何经济利益。如果你有任何关于程序方面的问题，请直接向Bill和John提出，因为我可能会太忙，而他们更熟悉具体交易。3月31日之后，我将有几个月不在办公室。因此如果你想谈事情，请在此之前来找我。完成购买可能要到四月份，比尔会负责此事，我们也将会履行完所有程序。

You should realize that because of the enormous diversity of issues mentioned earlier, it is impossible to say just what will be bought. Sometimes the tax-free bond market has more similarities to real estate than to stocks. There are hundreds of thousands of items of varying comparability, some with no sellers, some with reluctant sellers and some with eager sellers. Which may be the best buy depends on the quality of what is being offered, how well it fits your needs and the eagerness of the seller. The standard of comparison is always new issues where an average of several hundred million dollars worth have to be sold each week - however, specific secondary market opportunities (issues already outstanding) may be more attractive than new issues and we can only find out how attractive they are when we are ready to make bids.

你们应该意识到，由于前面提到的债券种类繁多，很难说我们到底会买什么。有时，免税债券市场与房地产的相似之处要多于股票。有数十万种不同的商品，有些没有卖家，有些有不情愿的卖家，有些有急于出售的卖家。哪种买法最好，取决于所提供商品的质量好坏、是否符合你的需求以及卖家的急切程度。新发行的债券始终是比较的标尺，它们每周的发行量高达数亿美元。然而，与新发行的债券相比，特定的二级市场（已发行的债券）的机会可能会更好，不过我们只有在准备好购买时才能发现后者的优势到底有多大。

Although markets can change, it looks as if we will have no difficulty in getting in the area of 6-1/2% after tax (except from Housing Authority issues) on bonds in the twenty-year maturity range.

尽管市场可能会发生变化，但我们似乎不难在20年期的债券中获得税后6.5%的收益（住房管理局发行的债券除外）。

[^1]: 此处的债券收益率曲线跟美国国债的不是一回事，它们的收益率曲线恰恰相反。这里巴菲特推荐购买的债券的收益率曲线是正向曲线，也就是跟本段最开始举的例子类似，期限越长债券利率越高。
