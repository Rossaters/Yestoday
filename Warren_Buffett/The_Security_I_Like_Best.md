Full employment, boom-time profits and record dividend payments do not set the stage for depressed security prices. Most industries have been riding this wage of prosperity during the past five years with few ripples to disturb the tide.

在充分就业、高企的利润以及创纪录的股息支付背景下，通常不会出现证券价格低迷的情况。过去五年间，大多数行业都乘着这股繁荣之风顺风顺水，几乎没有波折。

The auto insurance business has not shared in the boom. After the staggering losses of the immediate postwar period, the situation began to right itself in 1949. In 1950, stock casualty companies again took it on the chin with underwriting experience the second worst in 15 years. The recent earnings report of casualty companies, particularly those with the bulk of writings in auto lines, have diverted bull market enthusiasm from their stocks. On the basis of normal earning power and asset factors, many of these stocks appear undervalued.

然而，汽车保险业并未享受到这一繁荣。战后初期的巨额亏损之后，该行业在 1949 年开始逐渐恢复。但到了 1950 年，股份制意外保险公司的承保业绩再次陷入困境，成为 15 年来的第二差记录。近期，尤其是那些以汽车保险为主的公司的财务报告，已经减弱了牛市对它们股票的热情。从正常的盈利能力和资产状况来看，许多此类股票似乎被低估了。

The nature of the industry is such as to ease cyclical bumps. Auto insurance is regarded as a necessity by the majority of purchasers. Contracts must be renewed yearly at rates based upon experience. The lag of rates behind costs, although detrimental in a period of rising prices as has characterized the 1945-1951 period, should prove beneficial if deflationary forces should be set in action.

汽车保险行业的特性有助于抵御周期性波动。对多数消费者而言，汽车保险是必需品。保险合同需要每年基于过往经验更新费率。尽管在1945至1951年物价上涨期间，费率滞后于成本对行业是不利的，但如果通缩力量开始发挥作用，则应该会产生积极影响。

Other industry advantages include lack of inventory, collection, labor and raw material problems. The hazard of product obsolescence and related equipment obsolescence is also absent.

此外，该行业还有其他优势，如无需管理库存、收款、劳动力和原材料问题。产品和相关设备的过时风险也不存在。

Government Employees Insurance Corporation was organized in the mid-30’s to provide complete auto insurance on a nationwide basis to an eligible class including: (1) Federal, State and municipal government employees; (2) active and reserve commissioned officers and the first three pay grades of non-commissioned officers of the Armed Forces; (3) veterans who were eligible when on active duty; (4) former policyholders; (5) faculty members of universities, colleges and schools; (6) government contractor employees engaged in defense work exclusively, and (7) stockholders.  

政府雇员保险公司成立于30年代中期，旨在为特定群体提供全国范围的全面汽车保险服务，包括：（1）联邦、州和市政府雇员；（2）现役和预备役军官，以及武装部队前三级别的非委任军官；（3）在现役期间符合条件的退伍军人；（4）前保单持有人；（5）大学、学院和学校的教职员工；（6）专门从事国防工作的政府承包商雇员；以及（7）股东。

The company has no agents or branch offices. As a result, policyholders receive standard auto insurance policies at premium discounts running as high as 30% off manual rates. Claims are handles promptly through approximately 500 representatives throughout the country.  

公司没有代理人或分支机构，因此保单持有人可以享受高达手册费率 30% 的折扣。索赔由全国约 500 名代表迅速处理。

The term “growth company” has been applied with abandon during the past few years to companies whose sales increases represented little more than inflation of prices and general easing of business competition. GEICO qualifies as a legitimate growth company based upon the following record:  

“成长型公司”一词在过去几年被广泛使用，但往往用于那些销售增长主要源于价格通胀和商业竞争减弱的公司。GEICO 则凭借其卓越的发展记录，真正符合成长型公司的定义：

Year</br>年份|Premiums Written</br>承保保费|Policyholders</br>保单持有人数量
---|---:|---:
1936|\$ 103,696.31|3,754
1940|768,057.86|25,514
1945|1,638,562.09|51,697
1950|8,016,975.79|143,944

Of course the investor of today does not profit from yesterday’s growth. In GEICO’s case, there is reason to believe the major portion of growth lies ahead. Prior to 1950, the company was only licensed in 15 of 50 jurisdictions including D.C. and Hawaii. At the beginning of the year there were less than 3,000 policyholders in New York State. Yet 25% saved on an insurance bill of $125 in New York should look bigger to the prospect than the 25% saved on the $50 rate in more sparsely settled regions.  

当然，今天的投资者无法从昨天的增长中获利。对于 GEICO 而言，有理由相信大部分增长仍然在前方。在 1950 年之前，公司仅在 50 个司法管辖区中的 15 个获得许可。今年年初，纽约州的保单持有人不足 3,000 人。在纽约，一张 125 美元的保险账单上节省的 25%，对潜在客户来说，应该比在人口较少的地区 50 美元费率上节省的 25% 显得更加可观。

As cost competition increases in importance during times of recession, GEICO’s rate attraction should become even more effective in diverting business from the brother-in-law. With insurance rates moving higher due to inflation, the 25% spread in rates becomes wider in terms of dollars and cents.  

在经济衰退期间，成本竞争的重要性日益增加，GEICO 的费率优势应该会变得更加明显，更有效地从那些依赖“熟人介绍”而非性价比选择的业务中吸引客户。随着通货膨胀导致保险费率上涨，25% 的费率差距在金额上会变得更加显著。

There is no pressure from agents to accept questionable applicants or renew poor risks. In States where the rate structure is inadequate, new promotion may be halted.

公司没有来自代理人的压力去接受那些有问题的申请者或续保风险较高的保单。在那些保险费率结构不足以覆盖风险的州份，公司可能会暂停新的推广活动。

Probably the biggest attraction of GEICO is the profit margin advantage it enjoys. The ratio of underwriting profit to premiums earned in 1949 was 27.5% for GEICO as compared to 6.7% for the 135 stock casualty and surety companies summarized by Best’s. As experience turned for the worse in 1950, Best’s aggregate’s profit margin dropped to 3.0% and GEICO’s dropped to 18.0%. GEICO does not write all casualty lines; however, bodily injury and property damage, both important lines for GEICO, were among the least profitable lines. GEICO also does a large amount of collision writing, which was a profitable line in 1950.

GEICO 最大的吸引力可能是它享有的承保利润率优势。1949 年，GEICO 的承保利润占赚取的保费比例为 27.5%，相比之下，贝斯特汇总的 135 家股份制意外伤害和担保公司的平均比例仅为 6.7%。到了 1950 年，随着市场状况的恶化，贝斯特汇总的公司利润率下降到 3.0%，而 GEICO 的利润率下降到 18.0%。GEICO 并不提供所有类型的意外伤害保险，但身体伤害和财产损失保险——GEICO 的两项重要业务——却是利润最低的。此外，GEICO 还有大量的碰撞险承保业务，在 1950 年这一业务线是盈利的。”

During the first half of 1951, practically all insurers operated in the red on casualty lines with bodily injury and property damage among the most unprofitable. Whereas GEICO’s profit margin was cut to slightly above 9%, Massachusetts’s Bonding & Insurance showed a 16% loss, New Amsterdam Casualty an 8% loss, Standard Accident Insurance a 9% loss, etc.  

在 1951 年上半年，几乎所有保险公司在意外险种上都出现亏损，其中身体伤害和财产损失险种是最不盈利的。GEICO 的利润率虽然降至略高于 9%，但其他公司如马萨诸塞州保险公司显示了 16% 的损失，新阿姆斯特丹意外公司 8% 的损失，标准意外保险公司 9% 的损失等等。

Because of the rapid growth of GEICO, cash dividends have had to remain low. Stock dividends and a 25-for-1 split increased the outstanding shares from 3,000 on June 1, 1948, to 250,000 on Nov. 10 1951. Valuable rights to subscribe to stock of affiliated companies have also been issued.

由于政府雇员保险公司的快速增长，现金股利不得不保持低水平。股票股利和 25 比 1 的股票分割使股本从 1948 年 6 月 1 日的 3,000 股增加到 1951 年 11 月 10 日的 250,000 股。还发行了有价值的股票认购权，用于认购附属公司的股票。

Benjamin Graham has been Chairman of the Board since his investment trust acquired and distributed a large block of the stock in 1948. Leo Goodwin, who has guided GEICO’s growth since inception, is the able President. At the end of 1950, the 10 members of the Board of Directors owned approximately one-third of the outstanding stock.

自从本杰明·格雷厄姆的投资信托在 1948 年收购并分配了一大批股票以来，他就一直担任董事会主席。自 GEICO 成立以来一直指导公司成长的 Leo Goodwin 是一位能干的总裁。到 1950 年底，董事会的 10 名成员大约拥有三分之一的流通股。

Earnings in 1950 amounted to $3.92 as contrasted to $4.71 on the smaller amount of business in 1949. These figures include no allowance for the increase in the unearned premium reserve which was substantial in both years. Earnings in 1951 will be lower than 1950, reflecting the growth of the company’s assets.

1950 年的收益为 3.92 美元，相比之下，1949 年业务量较小的时候为 4.71 美元。这些数字没有考虑到未赚取保费准备金的增加，这在两年中都是相当大的。1951 年的收益将低于 1950 年，这反映了公司资产的增长。

At the present price of about eight times the earnings of 1950, a poor year for the industry, it appears that no price is being paid for the tremendous growth potential of the company.

考虑到行业在 1950 年这个不景气的年份，目前价格约为 1950 年收益的八倍，似乎没有为公司巨大的增长潜力付出任何代价。
