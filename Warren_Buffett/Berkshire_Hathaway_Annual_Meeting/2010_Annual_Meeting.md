**2010 meeting**

**Morning session**

**1. Opening remarks**

WARREN BUFFETT: Good morning. I’m Warren, he’s Charlie.

He can hear, I can see. We work together for that reason. (Laughter)

Like to make one correction in the movie. My fast ball was filmed in slow motion. They tried the regular way and you couldn’t even see it, so — (Laughter)

Our approach today will be to announce a couple of things, our earnings, and introduce you to the directors. But as soon as that’s through, we’ll move on to questions. We’ll have those until noon.

We’ll break for an hour and we’ll come back at 1:00. Those of you who are in the overflow rooms may find that you can get into the main arena here at that time.

And we’ll go till 3:30 with the questions and then we’ll have the annual meeting, business meeting, for those of you who are still around at that point. And at that time, we will have the election of directors.

**2. Board of directors introduced**

WARREN BUFFETT: But because not all of you may be here at that time, I would like to introduce the directors to you, and I’ll ask them to stand.

And if you’ll hold your applause until they’re all done standing, or you can even hold it after that — (laughter) — it will make — it will make for a very orderly meeting.

So let’s start in with Howard Buffett. I’m the next one alphabetically. Our new director, Steve Burke.

They didn’t hear the part about stay standing, but that’s OK. They’re generally fairly obedient, but the — (laughter)

Susan Decker. Bill Gates. David Gottesman, Sandy Gottesman. Charlotte Guyman.

Don Keough is unable to be with us today. He’s had a serious operation but he’s recovering very well and he’s got a lot of friends in this audience and he’ll be with us next year.

Charlie, we’ve already introduced. Tom Murphy. Ron Olson, the manager in our movie. And Walter Scott.

Now you can go wild with applause for the group. (Applause)

**3. Some recovery for “sputtering” economy**

WARREN BUFFETT: Now, before we start with the questions, we do have preliminary earnings figures for the first quarter.

And I’d like to ask the projectionist to put up slide A. There’s nothing really very surprising in these numbers, but we’d like to give them to you. They up there OK? Yeah. If you have any questions on these later on.

What we’re seeing in our businesses is that, in what was sort of a sputtering recovery a few months ago, seems to have picked up steam in March and April.

And our businesses that kind of serve broad industry, such as the railroad or Marmon or ISCAR, we’re seeing a pretty good uptick. It’s a long way from where it was a couple years ago, but what was very spotty in the recovery a couple of months ago, the trends really seem a fair amount stronger in the last few months.

And we always encourage you to focus on operating earnings. We have the figures there for our investments and derivative businesses.

We don’t really think they mean anything on a quarterly basis. Obviously, they’re meaningful over the years. I mean, we’ve piled up a lot of net worth over the years with capital gains. But in any quarter, they mean absolutely nothing.

And you’ll notice another thing about our report. We don’t even put down — we have to when we publish generally — but we don’t even put down the earnings per share. We’re not focused on that number in any quarter or any year.

We’re focused on the buildup of value. And we really think that an undue focus on quarterly earnings, not only is probably a bad idea for investors, but we think it’s a terrible idea for managers.

If I had told our managers that we would earn three dollars and 17 1/2 cents for the quarter, you know, they might do a little fudging in order to make sure that we actually came out at that number.

And there was a very interesting study that was published a few months ago where thousands of earnings reports were examined.

And instead of taking it out to the penny, which is customary in the reporting, they took it out one further digit. And of course if you go out one further digit, and it’s four or less, you round downward, and if it’s five or more, you round upward.

And they found out that a statistically impossible number of — small number — of fours showed up because if they got to four-tenths of a cent, somehow somebody in the accounting department managed to find another tenth of a cent so they could round upward. It was not an accident.

And, you do not want to have — in our view, we think it’s terrible practice to be thinking about trying to report to some penny that you’ve whispered to Wall Street analysts in previous months.

And we probably carry that to an extreme at Berkshire. But we always think of the enterprise as a whole. We think about building value over time.

And we do not worry about earnings per share, and we don’t worry about investment gains or losses.

Charlie may want to weigh in on this one a bit. Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I agree with you. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. He is the perfect vice chairman. (Laughter) They don’t come any better. OK.

With that preliminary — we probably ought to quit at that point, actually. (Laughter)

**4. Panel of journalists introduced**

WARREN BUFFETT: We’re going to alternate the questions between a panel of three journalists here. We have Carol Loomis of Fortune magazine on the — on the far right. (Applause)

And we didn’t do it quite alphabetically. We have Andrew Ross Sorkin from The New York Times. (Applause)

And Becky Quick of CNBC. (Applause)

Andrew’s maneuvered for a seat there, apparently, to get earlier in the questioning order, but I’ll probably stick with the alphabetical list.

And we will alternate between our journalists, and then we will go around the auditorium here where people have been chosen by chance to ask questions.

And we also will go to just I guess one of the overflow rooms; we have a whole lot of overflow rooms, but we’ll not go to all of them.

**5. To be deleted**

WARREN BUFFETT: So let’s just start things off. Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: Well, since I won the alphabetical lottery, I get to make two very short statements also.

One is that we received an awful lot of questions. We really don’t know how many because some people sent their question to all three of us. But I would guess we had something between 1,500 and 2,000 questions.

And obviously, we’re not going to be able to ask all of those, and we’re sorry for those we didn’t get to ask. They were very good questions and we appreciate the work that people put into them.

The other thing I want to mention is that Warren and Charlie have had absolutely no hint as to what the questions will be so they will have to field them just as they come up.

**6. Buffett strongly defends Goldman Sachs**

CAROL LOOMIS: However, Warren and Charlie may be smart enough to have guessed that the first question will be about topic A, which is Goldman Sachs.

And I received several emails about the SEC’s lawsuit against Goldman, all of them asking a different question about that problem.

I have combined the several thoughts in these questions, and with thanks to Greg Firman (PH), Kai Pan (PH) of Morgan Stanley, Brian Chan (PH), and Vic Timono (PH), here is the question:

Warren, every year in the Berkshire movie, you did it again today, you use the clip from the Salomon crisis in which you tell Congress that you have warned Salomon’s employees that if they lose a shred of the firm’s reputation, you will be ruthless in your reaction.

Clearly, Goldman Sachs has lost reputation because of the SEC’s action. Could you tell us your reaction to the lawsuit, your reflections in light of it about Berkshire’s large investment in Goldman?

And what advice, in light of your own Salomon experience, you would give Goldman’s board of directors and management?

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Anytime you ask me these multiple questions, I may go back to you to get all parts.

But, well, let’s start with the transaction, because that’s the important thing.

A few weeks ago on a Friday, a transaction described as ABACUS was made the subject of an SEC complaint. I think it ran about 22 pages. And I think there’s been probably sort of misreporting, not intentional obviously, but misreporting of the nature of that transaction in at least — probably a majority of the accounts that I’ve read about it.

So, I would like — this will take a little time, but I think it’s an important subject. I would like to go through that transaction first. And then we’ll get further into the questions posed by the people that emailed Carol.

The transaction, the ABACUS transaction, there were four losers in, but we’re going to focus on two of them.

Goldman itself was a loser. They didn’t intend to be a loser, I’m sure. They couldn’t sell the piece — a piece of the transaction — and they kept it, and I think they lost 90 or $100 million because they kept it.

But the main loser, in terms of actual cash out, was a very large bank in Europe named ABN AMRO, which subsequently became part of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

Now, what did ABN AMRO — why did they lose money? They lost money because they, in effect, guaranteed the credit of another company, ACA.

ABN AMRO was in the business of judging credits, deciding what credits they would accept themselves, what credits they would guarantee.

And in effect, they did something in the insurance world called fronting a transaction, which really means guaranteeing the credit of another party.

We have done that many times at Berkshire. We get paid for it. And people do not want the credit of the XYZ insurance company but they say they’ll take a policy from XYZ if we guarantee it. And Berkshire has made a lot of money guaranteeing things over the years.

And Charlie can remember back to the early 1970s when we ran into some very dishonest people and we lost money, and we lost a fair amount of money at that time, because we guaranteed the credit of somebody that turned out to be not so good.

It happened to be some syndicates at Lloyd’s, of all things. But they found ways not to pay when our name was on it.

So ABN AMRO agreed to guarantee about $900 million of the credit of a company called ACA. They got paid for that, and this is in the SEC complaint. It’s not mentioned very often, but they got paid, what, 17 basis points, that’s 17/100 of 1 percent.

So they took on a $900 million risk of guaranteeing credit. They got paid about a million-six. And the company whose credit they guaranteed went broke, and so they had to pay the 900 million. It’s a little hard for me to get terribly sympathetic with the fact that a bank made a dumb credit deal.

But let’s look at ACA, because they were sort of the nub of the transaction.

ACA, and you wouldn’t really know this by reading most press accounts, ACA was a bond insurer. Now, they started out as a municipal bond insurer. They guaranteed various credits and they were like Ambac, they were like MBIA, they were like FGIC, they were like FSA.

And all of those companies — and we wrote about this a few years ago in the report — all of those companies started out insuring municipal bonds. Some of them started 30 years ago. And there was a big business in insuring municipal bonds.

And then the profit margins started getting squeezed in the municipal bond business. So what did they do? Instead of sticking to the business they knew and accepting lower profits, they went out and got into the business of insuring structured credits and all kinds of different other deals.

I described their activities a couple years in the annual report as being a little bit like Mae West who said, “I was Snow White but I drifted.” (Laughter)

These bond insurers — and almost all of them did it — these bond insurers drifted into insuring things they didn’t understand quite as well but where they could make a little more money.

ACA did it, MBIA did it, AMBEC did it, FGIC did it, FSA did it, and they all got into trouble, every one of them.

Now, is there anything wrong with a bond insurer insuring structured credit or something other than municipals? No. But you better know what you’re doing.

Now, interestingly enough, Berkshire Hathaway, when these other guys got into trouble, went into the municipal bond insurance business.

And we insured things that were almost identical to what ACA or others had insured, the difference being that we thought we knew more about what we were doing. We got paid better than they got paid, and we stayed away from things we didn’t understand.

We never insured a CDO; we never insured any kind of a RMBS deal or anything of the sort.

But I want to give you an example of something we did insure, because I think it will help you understand better this ABACUS transaction. So if the — if the projectionist would put up slide number 1, I’m going to describe a deal to you.

And as you — as you look at this — is it up there yet? Yeah. Somebody came to us a couple of years ago. I’ll tell you the name a little later. But a large investment bank came to us a couple of years ago.

Now, we were insuring bonds regularly. We insured bonds here of the Omaha Public Power District that’s familiar to many of you. We insured the bonds of the Nebraska — of the Methodist Hospital, which is six or seven miles from here.

We have told people that if the Nebraska Methodist Hospital does not pay its bonds, Berkshire Hathaway will pay them. And we’ve done that to the tune of about $100 million in their case. So we are in the business of insuring bonds.

Now, a couple of years ago, somebody came to us, large investment bank, and they said, “Take a look at this portfolio.”

And as you can see, it’s got the names of a whole bunch of states. Yeah, it’s up there. And very different amounts. It’s got a billion-one for Florida; it’s only got 200 million for the State of California.

And they said to us, “Will you insure these states, that these bonds of these states, will pay for the next 10 years? If any of the states don’t pay, you have to pay as the insurer.”

And I looked at the list, Ajit Jain looked at the list, and we had to decide, A) whether we knew enough to insure them, and B) what premium we would charge, because that’s what we’re in the business for.

And we don’t have to insure them. We can say, “Forget it. We don’t know enough to make the decision.” But we made the decision and we offered to insure those bonds for about $160 million for 10 years.

So we collected a premium of a little over 160 million, and somebody on the other side, the counterparty they call it, somebody on the other side, for 10 years, gets an assurance that, if these states don’t pay, we will pay as if they did pay.

And this gets to the crux of the SEC’s case — or complaint — in respect to Goldman. Somebody came to us with this list; we didn’t dream up the list. Another party came to us.

Now, there’s about four possibilities. Now I’ll tell you who the party was that came to us two years ago: It was Lehman Brothers. So Lehman Brothers, there’s four possibilities, roughly.

Lehman Brothers might own these bonds and want protection against the credit. They might just be negative on the bond market and, in effect, be shorting these bonds and using this method as a way of shorting it.

They might have a customer that owned these bonds who wanted to buy protection against the credit.

Or they might have a customer who was negative on these bonds and was simply wanting to short it.

We don’t care which scenario exists. It’s our job to evaluate the risk of the bonds and to determine the proper premium.

If they told me Ben Bernanke was on the other side of the trade, it wouldn’t make any difference to me.

If I have to care about who’s on the other side of the trade, I should not be insuring bonds. They could have told me Charlie was on the other side of the trade. (Laughs)

So, in effect, we did with these bonds exactly what ACA did with the bonds that were presented to them.

Now, ACA said, with the list of 120 that was presented to them, they said, “There’s about 50 of these that we’re willing to insure.”

And then they went back and negotiated and took on 30 more of them.

We could have said, presumably, “We don’t like Texas that well at a billion-150, and we’d rather have you give us more Floridas,” or something like that.

We didn’t do it. We just took the list that was submitted. So it was totally the other guy’s list that we insured.

In the case of the ABACUS transaction, it was sort of a mutual — a negotiation — as to which bonds were included.

Now, in the end, the bonds that were included in the ABACUS transaction all went south very quickly.

That wasn’t quite so obvious they were going to do that in early 2007, as you could see by studying something called the ABX Index.

But the housing bubble — really, mania — started blowing up in 2007.

Now, there could be troubles in these states that we insured. You can say they have big pension obligations, and maybe the guy who’s shorting them on the other side knows more about that than we do, but, you know, that is our problem.

I mean, if we want to insure bonds, in the case of ACA, in the case of MBIA, they have teams of people do it. We just do it with a couple people at Berkshire.

But I see nothing whatsoever — I mean, if we lose a lot of money on these bonds, I am not going to go to the guy on the other side of the transaction and say, “Gee, you took advantage of me.”

I don’t care if John Paulson is shorting these bonds to me. He has no worries that I’m going to claim that he had superior knowledge about the finances of these states or anything of the sort.

So that was basically the ABACUS transaction. I think the central part of the argument is that Paulson knew more about the bonds than the bond insurer did.

My guess is the bond insurer employed more people than John Paulson did in his business, and they just made — they made what turned out, in retrospect, to be a dumb insurance decision.

And for the life of me, I don’t see whether it makes any difference whether it was John Paulson on the other side of the deal, or whether it was Goldman Sachs on the other side of the deal, or whether it was Berkshire Hathaway on the other side of the deal.

Let’s say we had decided to short the housing market in some way in early 2007. I don’t think anybody should blame us for taking our position if we did it. We didn’t do it. Or if we’d taken the long side.

I think before we get to the other part of Carol’s questions, I’d ask Charlie to comment as this as Charlie has a law degree, and in other ways is superior to me, so we’ll get his views.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, my attitude is quite simple. This was a three-to-two decision by the SEC commissioners under circumstances where they normally act unanimously.

If I had been on the SEC, I would have voted with the minority two and not with the three who authorized the lawsuit.

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol, would you get to the three parts that we probably haven’t answered yet? And then I’ll tackle this one.

But I really feel it’s important to understand the transaction. I have not seen — I have seen ACA referred to as an investor. It’s true that ACA had a management company, but it was 100 percent owned by ACA.

ACA was a bond insurer, pure and simple. And they had this — very simple, as it turned out — and they had one part of the organization did this and that. But ACA lost money because they were a bond insurer.

Yep, Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: Well, I’m assuming that you have covered the part that says could you tell us your reaction to the lawsuit. So the next part was your reflections, in light of it, about Berkshire’s large investment in Goldman.

And then the third was what advice you would have, given your Salomon experience and the thread of reputation that you have planted, those words you have planted. Those are the last two parts.

WARREN BUFFETT: Ironically, very ironically, it’s probably helped our investment in Goldman in a certain way, because we have a $5 billion preferred stock that pays us $500 million a year.

Goldman has the right, the legal right, to call that at 110 percent of par. So anytime they want to, they can sent Berkshire 5 1/2 billion, and they get rid of this preferred stock which is costing them 500 million a year.

If we got that 5 1/2 billion in, immediately we’d put it in very short-term securities, which probably, under today’s conditions, might produce 20 million a year or something like that.

So every day that goes by that Goldman does not call our preferred is money in the bank. It’s been pointed out that our preferred is paying us $15 a second. So as we sit here, tick — (laughter) — tick, tick, tick, that’s $15 every tick. (Applause)

I don’t want those ticks to go away. (Laughs)

I just love them. They go on at night when I sleep — (laughter) — on weekends.

And frankly, Goldman would love to get rid of that preferred. I mean, they only agreed to sell us that preferred because it was sort of at the height of the crisis.

The U.S., I’m not sure what part of the government, probably the Fed, but they have been telling companies that took TARP money whether they could increase their dividends or not, whether they could redeem preferred, and all that.

Up till now, probably the Federal Government has been doing us a big favor by telling — even before this thing happened — they’ve probably been telling Goldman that, “You can’t call that preferred until we tell you you can. And you can’t increase your dividend.”

They’ve been pretty strong with all of the TARP companies. That has not been publicized too much, but believe me that it’s the case.

So I was just sitting here hoping that the — basically, that the Fed, or whomever, would be — continue to be — quite tough, in terms of letting Goldman call our preferred. But it wasn’t going to go on forever.

I think that — I think recent developments have probably delayed the calling of our preferred by some time so the tick, tick, tick — (laughter) — will go on, and we will be getting $500 million a year instead of $20 million a year.

We love the investment, and I would expect that — the question about losing reputation.

There’s no question that the allegation alone causes the company to lose reputation, and obviously the press of the past few weeks, they hurt. They hurt a company. They can hurt morale, a lot of things. Nothing — it’s not remotely mortal or anything like that, but it hurts.

Incidentally, Goldman Sachs had a situation in connection with the Penn Central, 30 — 40 years ago now. And that hurt at that time.

They had a connection with one fellow in terms of Boesky that hurt at that time. And it was the source of great pain to John Weinberg, who was running Goldman.

But I don’t believe that the allegation of something falls within my category of losing reputation. If something is proven, then you have to look at it.

My advice, in times of some kind of an emergent — when some transgression is either found or alleged, you know, basically, you saw Ron Olson in our movie, he was the manager of the team.

And back when we were working at Salomon together in a somewhat similar situation, we had as our motto, “Get it right. Get it fast. Get it out. Get it over.”

But, “Get it right,” was number one. I mean, you have to have your facts right, because if you go out with the wrong facts you get killed, and you can’t redo it afterwards.

But that does mean sometimes some delay. You have to gather information from within your own organization, and you are on the defensive.

I would not — I do not hold against Goldman at all the fact that an allegation has been made by the SEC. And if it leads into something more serious, you know, then we’ll look at the situation at that time.

But what I’ve seen in terms of the ABACUS activity, I just don’t — I do not see that that would be any different than me complaining about the list of municipals that were given to me to insure a couple of years ago.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I agree with all of that. But I also think that every business ought to decline a lot of business that’s perfectly legal and proper to accept.

In other words, the standards in business should not be what’s legal and convenient. The standards should be different.

And I don’t think there’s an investment bank in America of any consequence that didn’t take too many scuzzy customers and deal in too many scuzzy securities.

WARREN BUFFETT: I would agree with that. But, Charlie — (applause) — do you think we should have done our municipal bond deal?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I think it was a closer case than you do.

WARREN BUFFETT: (Laughs) OK.

We insure, probably, 40 billion now, or something like that, of municipal bonds. And we have done very little in the last year, not because of Charlie’s views that he just expressed, but basically because the price isn’t right, the premiums are wrong.

And the reaction of other people when premiums are wrong is to take more risk. And our reaction when premiums are wrong is just to go play golf or something and tell somebody to call us when premiums get right again.

I do want to — Charlie and I will give our views on a lot of the activities that have gone on on Wall Street, and we do think plenty has been wrong.

I do want to point out, though, that our experience with Goldman goes back 44 years. And during those years, we’ve bought more businesses through them than through any other Wall Street investment bank. We’ve probably done more financing.

They have helped build Berkshire Hathaway. And we trade with them as well.

We don’t hire them as investment advisors. They have a big investment advisory business, and, you know, our reaction to that is, “No, thanks.” You know, we are in the business of making our own decisions.

But when we trade with them, they can very well be shorting to us a stock we’re buying. You know, they can be buying for their own account some stock we’re selling.

They do not owe us a divulgence of their position any more than we need to explain to them our reasoning or what we are doing in our position.

We are acting there in a non-fiduciary capacity, and they are operating in a non-fiduciary capacity, in my view, when they are trading with us.

Now, if they’re working on our behalf on an acquisition or a financing, that’s a different story.

But I would say that we have had a lot of very satisfactory transactions with Goldman Sachs.

And I don’t want to prolong this. I won’t do this on any more questions. But I’d like to — some people here will remember this — I’d like to take you back to the very first bond issue that Charlie and I ever did.

This was our maiden voyage back in 1967, I believe. Yeah. And if we could put slide 2 up there, I will direct your attention to the —

This is an offering that was made in 1967. We’d just bought a department store and we had a company called Diversified Retailing. Now, Diversified Retailing only owned one retailing operation, but we were sort of imaginative in those days, so we called it Diversified Retailing. (Laughter)

And we went out to raise $5 1/2 million. And Charlie Heider of Omaha, whom many of you know, helped me in the financing.

And you will notice our tombstone ad there has on the top two lines “New York Securities” and “First Nebraska Securities.”

They were the lead underwriters. And as customary with tombstones, there are a group of underwriters listed below, and they’re usually listed in the degree of their participation.

In other words, the more that they’re involved, the higher up in the list they are, with the lead underwriters on top. And that’s been true of every tombstone I’ve ever seen, except this one.

And what happened in this one was that we were having trouble raising $5 1/2 million. And I called Gus Levy of Goldman Sachs, and I called Al Gordon of Kidder Peabody. Those were two of the most prestigious firms in Wall Street at the time.

And I said, “Would you guys help me? We’re trying to raise 5 1/2 million and there’s nobody that wants to give Charlie and me 5 1/2 million. And the underwriters we’ve lined up are having trouble getting it done.” And both Gus Levy and Al Gordon said to me, “Warren, we’ll take a big piece.”

And if you’ll put — if you put up slide number 3, you will see the list of underwriters, and Goldman Sachs highlighted and Kidder Peabody highlighted were actually the next-largest underwriters. But they were so ashamed of being associated with our dinky little company that they asked us to leave their names off. (Laughter)

They wanted to give us money under an assumed name. (Laughter)

But they did — they did come through for us. They did come through for us. And believe me, a lot of people weren’t coming through for us then. I do have a long memory for people that have taken good care of Berkshire over time.

And Al Gordon died last year at the age of 107. He worked until he was 104. He was a remarkable man. Gus Levy was a remarkable man. And I thank them for their participation, even though they did want to do it under an assumed name. (Laughter)

**7. Munger: “I would make Paul Volcker look like a sissy”**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, we’ll go to — we’ll go to area number 1 and we’ll shorten the answers. (Laughs)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good morning, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. My name is Guy Pope and I’m from Portland, Oregon.

I’m curious about your thoughts on financial reform that Congress is currently working on. Specifically, what are the good ideas that you think are out there that should be included in the bill, and what are the bad ideas that you think should be left out?

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie, it’s 1,550 pages so you take the first 1,500, I’ll take the last 50 pages. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I don’t think anybody in America right now, including the people in Congress, know what’s going to happen. And my guess is that most of them have not read the bill, either.

So I think we’re all in the doubt — (applause) — as to what’s going to happen.

To me, one thing is perfectly clear and that is that our governmental system, which regulates the big investment banks, was so permissive and the investment banking culture had a nature, that together helped arrange that, under stress, every big investment bank except Goldman Sachs was going to go blooey.

A system that likely to go blooey, that is so important to the country, should be changed so it’s less permissive in what it allows the banks and the investment banks to do. And people are thinking about that right now.

The banks and investment banks just hate the idea of losing investment flexibility. For instance, on maintaining the biggest derivative book in the world at, say, JPMorgan Chase.

They hate giving that stuff up. That doesn’t mean that it’s good for the country that they be allowed to continue to do as they have done.

WARREN BUFFETT: Based on what you know about the bill, and I know you haven’t read all 1,550 pages, but would you vote for it today or not?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I simply don’t know enough about it. I know what I would do if I were the benevolent despot of America. And I would make Paul Volcker look like a sissy. (Laughter and applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: You want to get more specific than that? That’s quite a word picture. (Laughs)

Want to get more specific, Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I would reduce the activities that are permitted. If you’re de facto using the government’s credit to help your business run, you shouldn’t have a bunch of financial statements in the trillions, which you can’t really understand even if you’re a partner in the business.

This is crazy. The complexity that has come into the system is quite counterproductive. And of course, the people have proven they can’t really control it.

So I think what we need is a new version of Glass-Steagall that drastically limits what — (applause) — what both commercial banks and investment banks are allowed to do.

They should have a much simpler and safer mode of business.

When we owned a savings and loan association, it had a very restricted repertoire that it could use. And of course, it had government credit for its deposits.

And by and large, as long as the repertoire was quite limited, the savings and loans stayed out of trouble. But you give human beings the flexibility the do any damn thing they please with absolutely unlimited credit under the repo system and other systems, and they will go plum crazy. And of course, they did.

**8. We shouldn’t have to collateralize previous deals**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. On that cheery note, we’ll move to Becky. (Laughter)

BECKY QUICK: We received a lot of questions about the financial regulatory impending legislation. This question comes in from Jay Gelb, who wants to follow up on the point that Mr. Pope just made.

“What’s the anticipated impact of pending financial reform legislation on Berkshire? In particular, how much additional collateral may need to be posted on Berkshire’s existed $63 billion of derivative contracts? And could Berkshire get too close to its minimum requirement of $20 billion of cash on hand as a result?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. As I understand the bill now, the one that got presented a couple of days ago — and I could be wrong but I think I understand it and I’ve read the sections — the requirements would be zero.

If we were found — Berkshire were found — to be a — and I don’t know the exact term in the bill — but basically, dangerous to the system, by the secretary of the treasury, or I believe some commission, then we could be required to post collateral on retroactive contracts — on contracts that were written in the past.

I think the chances of us being regarded as a danger to the system when we have 250 contracts and other companies have a million contracts — our position was described in the Journal not long ago as “huge.”

You know, our position is 1 percent, in terms of notional value or liabilities or a lot of ways of measuring. It’s 1 percent of that of several other very large institutions.

So I — I’ve really wondered if you use the word “huge” to describe our position, what you would use for 100 times that position?

That must be some adjective that lurks out there someplace to be attributed to those other positions.

We had 23,000 positions 10 years ago when we bought Gen Re. And we proceeded promptly to get rid of all but less than a hundred that are left.

So we have absolutely, in my view, we have no problems.

If for any reason though, the Treasury or this commission should go back and maybe in some more sweeping declaration decide that they wanted all past contracts to be collateralized, we would comply, obviously.

We also would feel that we were due substantial money because, in negotiating those contracts, there was one price for collateralized contracts and there was another price for un-collateralized.

So if I sell my house to you for $100,000 and wanted $120,000 if it were furnished, but you said, “I’ll take it unfurnished for $100,000,” and then Congress comes along later on and says, “All houses have to be sold furnished, and by the way, that’s retroactive,” if I give you the furniture now I want something for it. A little unreasonable, maybe.

We do think — well, just a week ago we were offered an equity put contract that’s identical, basically, it’s a 10-year contract, by one of the very largest investment banking houses.

The price that they would pay us was 7 1/2 million un-collateralized and $11 million collateralized. So there’s a very different — there’s a price to be paid for having a collateralized contract.

And we elected to forgo probably a billion dollars of extra premiums we could have received in the past for our contracts if we had agreed to have them collateralized.

And with a few exceptions, we declined that. And we would feel, if we ever had to collateralize them, we would be entitled to fair compensation for it, and we would like that language to be in the bill.

And incidentally, Secretary Geithner — we’ll put up slide number 7. We have his testimony before the Senate Ag Committee on December 2nd. And as you can see, he testified very strongly, in terms of the sanctity of past contracts.

But if the bill passes tomorrow, the way it reads to us and to our attorneys, we would not have to put up a dime.

And I would think there might be some other companies that would be determined to be dangerous to the system before Berkshire Hathaway would be.

So I really — I don’t see any — I don’t see any consequences unless there’s some sweeping declaration that any company of a certain size that has derivatives shall be required to put up collateral.

And if that’s required, we will, and it would be no problem. It would — it would have a cost to us in terms of the opportunity cost, but then of course we would argue about what collateral was proper and so on.

And if we could put our Coca-Cola stock, you know, we’re going to hold our Coca-Cola stock anyway. So it really changes nothing. We still get the dividends from the Coca-Cola stock if it’s placed as collateral, we get the profit if it goes up.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, yes. If collateral requirements were inserted by fiat of the government into existing contracts, it would be just like having a contract to buy a house for a million dollars, and the government passing a law saying, “No, you’ve got to pay $2 million.”

I mean, it would be of dubious constitutionality, and it would be both unfair and stupid. I don’t think the government is that crazy. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Plus, I think what they would see — there’s a whole list, in fact I think I’ve got a page even for that. Yeah, let’s put up slide number 8.

And this is just a sample page of people who oppose putting up collateral — being required to put up collateral — prospectively. And you’ll see IBM, you’ll see Ford Motor, you’ll see 3M, you’ll see HCA.

I mean, there’s all kinds of companies that don’t want to do it in the future. We don’t care what we do in the future as long as we get paid for it.

So this is not anything that is peculiar to Berkshire at all. In fact, we happen to be in a different position than the IBMs and the 3Ms and those of the world, in respect to this. As long as we get paid for it, we’re indifferent to what the rules are going forward.

But considering the fact that we took lesser premiums in the past, we would not like something retroactively to take money out of our pocket.

But bear in mind, Burlington Northern, when we buy it, it has some fuel contracts. MidAmerican has energy contracts.

There was a story in Businessweek about Anheuser-Busch a couple of weeks ago. And, you know, they say, “We don’t want to take money out of our business and send it to Wall Street as a deposit on collateral.”

And I think when — if they really saw that the net effect of this would be to send a whole lot of money to be held by Wall Street that was otherwise employed in operating businesses, there might be a little less congressional enthusiasm.

**9. Greek debt crisis: “I don’t know how this movie ends”**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, we’ll go to number 2.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good morning to all of you. Switching topics, Charlie and Warren, I’m Norman Rentrop from Bonn, Germany. I want to first give you a big thank you and then a question.

“Come by train,” you wrote in the shareholder letter, and that is how I came to Omaha for the first time back in 1997.

I deliberately took the train from Denver to experience Omaha as a railroad city, and I immediately liked Omaha a lot. But the train ride, I saw room for improvement. So thank you very much for taking the future of American railroads into your gifted hands. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: That’s one of the best questions I’ve ever heard. (Laughter)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, here a question.

WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, OK. (Laughter)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: It’s about Greece, the future of the euro, and the fiscal discipline all over the world, and what we have to prepare for as investors.

In the past, you have been warning us about structural weaknesses of the U.S. dollar. Now we see Greece, and potentially other European countries, in crisis.

Berkshire has significant investments in the eurozone, the big ones like Cologne Re, Munich Re, and even small ones like ISCAR’s (inaudible) in Hamburg.

How are you preparing Berkshire Hathaway for potential currency failures? And what are your thoughts on the sustainability of the euro? And what is your advice for us as investors?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. I’m going to — Charlie and I have not talked about Greece, actually, recently, so I’m going to be very interested in hearing his views on that. I will — I’ll answer the last part of your question first.

We have a lot of exposure in various countries on both the asset and liability side. In other words, we do own stock in Munich Re, and they’ve got lots of assets, majority, probably, in the euro.

We have Cologne Re, a subsidiary of General Re, which has a substantial net worth that is basically tied to the euro.

On the other hand, we have very substantial liabilities that are denominated in other currencies, including fairly big time in the euro around the world.

For example, when we reinsured three or four years ago, three years ago maybe, Equitas, we took on many, many, many billions of liabilities around the world. And we were paid by, in effect, Lloyd’s. And we took that money and invested it in dollars.

So we keep those liabilities for all kinds of old insurance claims arising from Equitas in foreign currencies.

And if the euro depreciates against the dollar, we benefit on that side, but we lose, as you point out, on other sides.

I can’t tell you, and it’s something I’m not concerned about, whether our net balance in euros or sterling or yen or whatever, I can’t tell you what it is on any given day. Some of it enters into our equity put options and things of that sort.

But we have no dramatic exposures in any other currency. That doesn’t mean that other currencies are unimportant to us, because what happens with the Greek situation and what may fall out from that can be quite important, in terms of the world’s economy.

And Charlie’s going to explain to you exactly what that might be. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. Well, generally speaking and with rare exceptions, of course, we’re agnostic about currencies. We simply do our business and we take those fluctuations as they fall, wouldn’t you agree with that?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. We’re agnostic in terms of the relative values, of —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. Yes.

WARREN BUFFETT: — course. Yeah, we’re not agnostic about where we think all currencies are headed, generally.

CHARLIE MUNGER: No, no.

WARREN BUFFETT: But the relative value —

CHARLIE MUNGER: But —

WARREN BUFFETT: — agnostic.

CHARLIE MUNGER: — Greece presents an interesting problem, of course. What’s happened is that the past conservatism of a place like the United States gave it wonderful credit, a combination of success and conservatism.

And we used that credit to win World War II, and help revive Germany and Japan in one of the most constructive and intelligent foreign policy decisions ever made in the history of the world.

And we used that credit to help assure prosperity for all these decades in which Berkshire has flourished.

And now, of course, the government does not have quite as good a credit as it had before it started using it so heavily. And that’s happened pretty much all over the world.

And so Greece is just the start of a very interesting period, and of course, it’s more dangerous to civilization when governments push their credit so hard.

Because if you need credit to help civilization function, and you’ve blown it by your own aggression in using it in the past, that’s not a good thing.

And I think in this country, and in other countries too, responsible voices are now realizing that we’re nearer trouble from lack of government credit than we’ve been, well, in my lifetime.

WARREN BUFFETT: Everything you read about country credits, currency, you always want to make a — you always want to distinguish between countries that are borrowing in their own currency pretty much exclusively, like Japan has or the United States, and countries that are being forced for one reason or another, because the world doesn’t trust them, to borrow in other countries’ currencies.

I mean, in the past, you know, if you were some South American country and you were borrowing in your own currency, you never default, you just buy a new printing press or work it a little harder.

But the world doesn’t like that sort of thing. So with weaker credits, and countries with poorer reputations, they force those countries to borrow in other currencies, frequently the United States currency.

And that can really put you out of business very quickly because, you can’t — if you’re some South American country, you can’t print U.S. dollars, although you can print your own currency. And that’s what’s caused failures among countries.

The European Monetary Union, it’s a really interesting situation, because Greece, they are a sovereign country, in terms of their own budget. But they can’t print their own currency, you know, they’ve got the euro.

And this is — you know, the euro was regarded as quite an experiment 20 years or whenever it was ago, or less than that. But you may be seeing sort of a test case play out here of a country that is not using its own currency, in effect, or using a common currency, and yet is sovereign, in terms of making its own promises to its citizens.

And I don’t know how this movie ends. That doesn’t mean I’m forecasting disaster or anything, I really just don’t know how this movie ends. And I try not to go to movies like that, if I can. (Laughter)

But I’ll be watching. Really, this will be high drama, in my view, what happens here.

The one thing, Charlie says we’re agnostic on currencies, and we don’t make big currency plays. We did make one a few years ago and we did all right on it. But we very seldom will develop a strong view on one currency versus another.

I would say this though, that events in the world of the last few years would make me more bearish on all currencies, in terms of their future — holding their value over time — than previously. But it’s not unique to the United States, it’s not unique to the United Kingdom.

If you really could run budget deficits of 10 percent of your GDP and do it for a long period of time, believe me, the world would have been doing it a long before this. I mean, that is — that’s a lot of fun if you can keep it up.

And the reason it hasn’t been done in the past, I think, is probably that most people understand that it can’t be kept up.

And how the world weans itself off huge deficit financing by country after country after country — it’s going to be easy — I mean, it’s going to be interesting — to watch.

You do not need to worry; as long as the United States government borrows in U.S. dollars, there is no possibility, none, of default. If the world won’t take our obligations denominated in dollars then we — then you have a real problem.

But you don’t default when you can print your own currency.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, yes. And of course, the published statistics are quite misleading because the debts of the currencies — of the countries — are normally stated in terms of the government bonds outstanding, and the unfunded promises of the various governments are much greater than the government bonds outstanding.

So whatever you think this problem is when you read the statistics, it’s miles bigger.

And those unfunded promises don’t bind if you keep growing GDP at 2 or 3 percent per annum, per person, or something like that. You can afford the unfunded promises.

But if you get to where the growth stops, then you’re going to have enormous social strains. And God knows what the effect will be on government policy and on currencies.

**10. Did Goldman need to disclose SEC notice?**

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew, you’ve been very patient.

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: I’ve received over 300 questions just related to Goldman Sachs, and I know we’ve covered it already but there are a couple outstanding questions and one individual sent three specific questions that I thought I’d ask.

The first is, since Berkshire is a Goldman shareholder, who would you like the see run Goldman Sachs if not Lloyd Blankfein?

Were you made aware of Goldman’s Wells notice, or anything about the case, prior to it being brought?

Do you think the Wells notice constituted material information and should have been disclosed? Would have you disclosed it?

And finally, have you been contacted as part of the Galleon investigation and the allegation that a Goldman Sachs board member passed inside information about your pending investment in Goldman in 2008 at the height of the crisis to Galleon?

I know there’s a lot of pieces to that, but I thought we’d get Goldman out of the way —

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, good.

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: — right now.

WARREN BUFFETT: Good. Yeah. Well, let’s answer the third one first.

We’ve not been contacted in any way about Galleon. I read about that in the paper and the allegation, apparently, of a contact between a Goldman director and Galleon.

And I think in one of the stories, I read something about, presumably, Galleon trading on it. But the answer is no contact from anybody. And I can’t pronounce the name of the guy that runs Galleon. (Laughter)

The Wells notice, I’ve talked to a number of lawyers about that. And I think — when we got a — we didn’t get the Wells notice, but when the Gen Re executives got the Wells notice, I’m quite sure we stuck that in the 10-K or 10-Q that came up.

And maybe we filed an 8-K announcing it. That was not us receiving it ourselves but certain executives receiving it.

I have been on the board of at least one well-known company over the past 40 years, and I won’t narrow it down any more than that.

But before, they received a Wells notice and they didn’t publicize it, and, in truth, it was nothing. So lawyers tell me that if you regard it as material, you report it.

I don’t think if I’d received something relating to the ABACUS transaction, based on what I know about it, I would have considered it material to a company that was making many, many, many billions of dollars a year.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I wouldn’t have regarded it as material, either.

If every company reported every little thing that might happen with what they regarded a tiny probability, we’d just have unlimited confusing reports.

There has to be some materiality standard. And you don’t want to give blackmail potential to people that are mad at you and make claims. I’m not saying that’s what the SEC was doing, but —

WARREN BUFFETT: No, but it could happen with a lot of — (laughter) it could happen with individual —

CHARLIE MUNGER: It could happen with other people, yeah.

WARREN BUFFETT: And I know what percentage of Wells notices result in something that’s material to the company. But my guess is that there are plenty of them that wouldn’t be.

And of course, the bigger the company, the less likelihood that it would be material.

And then your other question about who I would want running, if Lloyd wasn’t running it?

I guess if Lloyd had a twin brother, I’d go for him. But I’ve never given that a thought.

We think about who would run Berkshire — (laughs) — but there’s really no reason to think about that.

There wasn’t any reason to think about, in my view, back in 1970, when they had the Penn Central problem whether somebody other than Gus Levy should be running Penn Central — be running Goldman.

And when the event happened in connection with the Boskey thing, John Weinberg was running it then. And I thought that John Weinberg was a terrific manager of Goldman.

So I just don’t see this as reflecting on Lloyd.

I think, as Charlie — and we’ve got strong feelings. There’s plenty of stuff goes on Wall Street that we don’t like. But we do not think it’s specific — we know it isn’t specific — to Goldman.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, there are plenty of CEOs I’d like to see gone in America. (Laughter)

But Lloyd Blankfein is not one of them.

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, number 3. (Laughter)

I was afraid he might start naming names. (Laughter)

**11. Driver feedback technology**

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. My name is David Clayman (PH) and I come from Chicago, Illinois. This question is for Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates, principally as Berkshire shareholders, but also as Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation trustees.

The leading cause of death for Americans my age are motor vehicle crashes. Over 6 million occur each year and you insure a significant number of these crashes.

The World Health Organization ranks motor vehicle crashes as the 11th leading cause of death in the world.

A new category of technologies are reaching the market. These technologies not only reduce driver distraction but also deliver positive feedback to drivers to help make drivers aware of how well they’re driving or how much better they could be doing.

Will GEICO or the Gates Foundation make an aggressive and visible bet on driver feedback technologies to stimulate road focus and save life, liberty, property, and insurance premiums?

I have a note here for Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett. I’d be happy if I could get these to you somehow.

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, I think we know your position. (Laughter)

The Gates Foundation, I think, has a fairly major initiative, along with Mayor Bloomberg, in terms of cigarette smoking. And I think you’ll find a whole lot more people have been affected by that than auto accidents.

Auto accidents per mile driven, auto deaths, have diminished. I thought I heard a figure of six — I thought the figure was more in the 30,000 to 40,000 range actually, but it’s diminished over the years.

You know, there have been a lot of things done to make cars safer. I’m not sure that cell phones and BlackBerries are among them. (Laughter)

And I think they actually are — there will be more people die in auto accidents because the cell phone and various other instruments were invented than would otherwise be the case. I don’t know how significant that item will be.

But everybody has an interest in bringing down fatalities. And GEICO has a very active safety program, testing cars, doing all kinds of things, working usually in conjunction with other insurance companies.

I do not think that — The Gates Foundation has fairly specific and intelligent, in my view, guidelines as to where they direct their activities, and they believe in focus, so they are not going to try and solve every problem in the world.

But I can assure you that the insurance industry, as well as auto companies generally, are continuously working to make cars safer.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I’ve got nothing to add. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: OK.

**12. Berkshire shares not affected by Buffett’s donations**

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: This question also concerns the Gates Foundation but it’s entirely different.

“One of your owner-related business principles says that you will attempt, through your policies and communications, to keep Berkshire’s stock price rational.

“Yet every year, you give large amounts of your Berkshire stock to the Gates Foundation. And my understanding is that more will go to the foundation when you die.”

By the way, I forgot to say this is from Michael McLaughlin (PH) of Omaha, who continues: “Already, we have seen that foundation regularly sell Berkshire stock, and it will sell more because its purpose is to give money to charities not hold the stock forever.

“Won’t the foundation selling create a downward pressure on the stock because as much as 25 percent of it will be turned over?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Basically, there’s five foundations I give money to every year, every July.

And the amount I would be giving now, it’s a 5 percent declining balance, the amount I would be giving now would amount to about 1 1/2 percent of the shares outstanding annually, something like that.

So if they sell, and they will, that stock fairly promptly after receipt in order to make charitable gifts, you basically have 1 1/2 percent of the shares being sold annually.

Now, if you contrast that with trading on the New York Stock Exchange, which averages well over 100 percent of the amount of shares outstanding, it’s not anything unusual at all in the way of sales.

And it is a free country. I mean, I could sell 10 percent of the company if I wanted to. I’ve never sold a share in my life, and I never plan to sell a share in my life. And I won’t sell a hell of a lot of shares after I die either, probably. (Laughter)

If 1.5 percent of the outstanding shares at Berkshire move the price down in a year, it probably deserves to move down.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, of course, I regard that degree of stock distribution to aid charity as almost a nonevent, and it may actually have been a constructive event, in terms of getting Berkshire into the Standard and Poor’s indexes and so on.

WARREN BUFFETT: Excuse me.

CHARLIE MUNGER: I think you’ve got more important things to worry about. (Laughs)

WARREN BUFFETT: If I’d owned 100 percent of Berkshire, for sure it would not have been in the S&P 500. It was always a problem of concentration.

So if by selling down it enhanced — and it did to some degree — enhanced the chances of Berkshire being in the S&P 500, that probably accounted for maybe 7 percent or so of the capitalization, some number like that.

So that was extraordinary, you might call it, buying that was brought in, to some extent because of the diminution of my own holdings.

As Charlie said, I would say if none of the stock had been given away in the last four years, I don’t know whether — I have no idea — whether the stock would be selling a little higher or a little lower. I think that’s sort of an even money bet.

**13. Buffett: “I would not run from the United States”**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, number 4.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello, Mr. Buffett. Hello, Mr. Munger. My name’s Vern Cushenbery. I’m from Overland Park, Kansas.

What do you see as the biggest challenge facing the United States economy relative to other countries? And what are the implications of that with regard to investing globally over the next decade?

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie? (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Thank you for steering that easy problem to me. (Laughter)

I think the answer to that is that by and large we haven’t made our way in life by having great global allocations systems.

Berkshire’s attitude, generally, is to find things that seem sensible to us and to concentrate, to some extent, in those matters. And then let the world economy and the world’s currency fluctuations fluctuate as they will.

I do think we’d prefer some countries to others, and the more responsible the countries seem, the more comfortable we are. Wouldn’t you agree with that?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. But we —

CHARLIE MUNGER: But beyond that, we can’t help you very much because we really don’t have a global allocation system at Berkshire, unless Warren is keeping it secret from me. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Not that one. (Laughter)

We did not buy Burlington Northern with the idea of moving it to China or India or Brazil — (laughter) — and we love that. We love the fact that Burlington Northern is in the United States.

The biggest threat we have is some kind of a massive nuclear, chemical, or biological attack of one sort or another.

And if you would say what are the probabilities of that over a 50-year period, it’s pretty high. Over a one-year period, it’s very low.

But if you talk about whether the qualities that have led to the last 220 years of incredible progress, with a lot of hiccups, but incredible progress, you know, in the status of mankind that we’ve experienced in these two centuries compared to any two centuries you want to pick out in history, this country is remarkable and its system is remarkable.

And it does unleash human potential like has never been seen before.

This crowd here is not smarter than a similar crowd 200 years ago, and they don’t work harder.

But, boy, do they live differently. And they live differently because this system has enabled fairly ordinary people, over a period of time, to do extraordinary things. And that game isn’t over.

There is nothing that says we have come close, in my view, to the limits of what humans can achieve.

We probably don’t even know our own potential, any more than the people in 1790 knew their own potential. I mean, they thought it would be great if somebody finally came along with some farm tool that let them work 10 hours a day instead of 12 hours a day.

So I — there’s no reason — you know, I hope the rest of the world does well, and I think they will do well. And it is not a zero-sum game. If China and India do well, that does not mean we do worse; it may mean we do better.

So we are not — it’s not what they get is taking it away from us. But I would be perfectly content if Berkshire Hathaway were forced in some way to limit its investment to the opportunities available in the United States.

We would have plenty of opportunities. I’d rather have the whole world, obviously, in terms of opportunities, but there will be ample in this country. I would not run from the United States. OK. (Applause)

**14. No rush to find new investment chief**

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This is a question that has to do with the Berkshire succession plans. It comes from Craig Merrigan in Sprucegrove who asks, “How did the four potential candidates for Berkshire’s CIO position perform over the course of 2008 and 2009?

“Did any of the four employ leverage? And have any of the four now been excluded from consideration?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yes, the answer to that is that, in 2008, I reported to you last year that they didn’t, I think we got a question like that last year, they did not distinguish themselves. 2009, they did pretty darn well.

It’s not — I would say that the four — it’s not the same four. I would say that none of them, Charlie, I believe you may use leverage at all. Do you think so?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, the one with which I’m most familiar made a little over 200 percent using leverage of zero.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, that narrows it down. (Laughter)

The potential investment people, that list will be subject to more movement around than probably the CEO succession.

And it’s really far less urgent. If I die tonight, there will be a new CEO in place in Berkshire within 24 hours, and all the directors know who it would be, and they’re all comfortable with it.

And there should be somebody in place within 24 hours.

The investments, they don’t need anything done next week. I can go on vacation on investments. And we could go — we wouldn’t do it, or the directors wouldn’t do it, I won’t be there — but they could wait a month, they could wait two months.

I mean, the Coca-Cola isn’t going to go away, Procter & Gamble’s not going to go away, American Express. There’s no great need to be doing things day by day. We don’t do things day by day.

So they can be fairly leisurely in working out, probably in conjunction with a new CEO, who they would like to bring in, how they would like to compensate them, what the number might be.

That is not fixed in stone at all. The one thing I can tell you is that there are some very able people who would like very much, I think, to be managing money for Berkshire, and who would do a good job, and who are familiar to at least some of the directors. And that problem would get solved.

The CEO problem — which is not a problem — but the CEO question, you want an answer for right now and you want to be prepared to implement it, you know, the next day, although I did just have a physical. (Laughs) Came out fine. (Laughter)

Charlie? (Applause)

My doctor isn’t here today so I will tell you, it drives him nuts because I eat like I do and he can’t find anything wrong — (laughs) — and he wants to, believe me. (Laughter)

And with that —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well I’m — (Laughter)

I am not the most optimistic of the two people up here. And — (laughter) — yet, I’m quite optimistic that the culture of Berkshire will last a long, long time and will outlast, greatly, the life of the founder. I think it’s going to work.

WARREN BUFFETT: I really think — I mean, we shouldn’t be getting into superlatives — but I think we have as strong a culture, and as distinctive a culture, in terms of managers, ownership, the whole works, of any really large company in the country.

And it’s taken a long time to develop, but it becomes self-reinforcing after a point. And we love it, and I think they’ll love it after I’m gone. (Applause)

Don’t clap there. (Laughter)

**15. Good, but not brilliant, returns for businesses needing capital**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, number 5.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, I’m Steve Fulton (PH) from Louisville, Kentucky. Once again, I gave up a box seat to the Kentucky Derby to come ask you a question. (Laughter)

And I appreciate that opportunity.

My question’s focused on the shift, if you will, to investing in the capital-intensive businesses and the related impact on intrinsic value.

You again stated in the annual report that best businesses for owners are those that have high returns on capital and require little incremental capital.

I realize this decision is somewhat driven by the substantial amounts of cash that the current operating companies are spinning off, but I would like you to contrast the requirement for this capital against the definition of intrinsic value, which is the discounted value of the cash that’s being taken out.

And just for all of us to be aware, you’ve mentioned the fact that you think these businesses will require tens of billions of dollars over the few decades, and just the time value of that, I’d like to understand a little bit more of your insight into that.

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Although it’s clear you understand the situation quite well, and it’s — as important a question as you could ask, virtually, I would say, at Berkshire.

We are putting money into good — big money — into good businesses from an economic standpoint. But they are not as good as some we could buy when we were dealing with smaller amounts of money.

If you take See’s Candy, it has 40 million or so of required capital in the business, and, you know, it earns something well above that.

Now, if we could double the capital, if we could put another 40 million in at anything like the returns we receive on the first 40 million, I mean, we’d be down there this afternoon with the money.

Unfortunately, the wonderful businesses don’t soak up capital. That’s one of the reasons they’re wonderful.

At the size we are, we earn operating earnings, $2.2 billion, or whatever it was in the first quarter, and we don’t pay it out, and our job is to put that out as intelligently as we can.

And we can’t find the See’s Candies that will sop up that kind of money. When we find them, we’ll buy them, but they will not sop up the kind of money we’ll generate.

And then the question is, can we put it to work intelligently, if not brilliantly? And so far, we think the answer to that is yes.

We think it makes sense to go into the capital-intensive businesses that we have. And incidentally, so far, it has made sense. I mean, it’s worked quite well. But it can’t work brilliantly.

The world is not set up so that you can reinvest tens of billions of dollars, and many, many tens over time, and get huge returns. It just doesn’t happen.

And we try to spell that out as carefully as we can so that the shareholders will understand our limitations.

Now, you could say, “Well, then aren’t you better off paying it out?”

We’re not better off paying it out as long as we can translate, as you mentioned, the discounted value of future cash generation. If we can translate it into a little something more than a dollar of present value, we’ll keep looking for ways to do that.

In our judgment, we did that with BNSF, but the scorecard will be written on that in 10 or 20 years.

We did it with MidAmerican Energy. We went into a business, very capital intensive, and so far, we’ve done very well, in terms of compounding equity.

But it can’t be a Coca-Cola, in terms of a basic business where you really don’t need very much capital, if any, hardly. And you can keep growing the business if you’re lucky, if you’ve got a growing business.

See’s is not a growing business. It’s a wonderful business, but it doesn’t translate itself around the world like something like Coca-Cola would.

So I would say you’ve got your finger right on the right point. I think you understand it as well as we do. I hope we don’t disappoint you, in terms of putting money out to work at decent returns, good returns.

But if anybody expects brilliant returns from this base in Berkshire, you know, we don’t know how to do it.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I’m just as good at not knowing as you are. (Laughter)

**16. Making loans vs. buying stock in credit crisis**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, Andrew? (Laughter)

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question comes from Victor and Amy Liu (PH) who are shareholders from Santa Monica, California.

And they ask, “When you made investments during the financial crisis in February of 2009, why did you lean towards debt instruments rather than equity?

“For example, why did you invest $300 million in Harley-Davidson at 15 percent interest instead of buying equity when the shares were at $12? Today, they’re at $33.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I would say that if I were writing that question now, I might write the same question. But I’m not so sure you would have written the same question in February.

Now, there were different risk profiles, obviously, in investing. And the truth is, I don’t know whether Harley-Davidson equity is worth $33 or $20 or $45. I just have no view on that.

You know, I kind of like a business where your customers tattoo your name on their chest or something. But — (laughter) — figuring out the economic value of that, you know. I’m not sure even going out and questioning those guys I’d learn much from them. (Laughter)

But I do know, or I thought I knew, and I think I was right, that, A) Harley-Davidson was not going out of business. And that, B) 15 percent was going to look pretty damned attractive.

And the truth is, we could probably sell those bonds, I don’t know, probably at 135 or something like that. So we could have a very substantial capital gain, a lot of income.

I knew enough to lend them money; I didn’t know enough to buy the equity. And that’s frequently the case. And, you know, we love buying equities, but we love buying the Goldman preferred at 10 percent.

Now, let’s say Goldman, instead of offering me the 10 percent preferred and warrants had said, “You can have a 12 percent preferred, non-callable,” I might have taken that one instead. I mean, the callable — so there’s a tradeoff involved in all these securities.

And obviously, if I think I can make very good money, as we did on Harley-Davidson, with a very simple decision, just a question of, “Are they going to go broke or not?” as opposed to a tougher decision, “Is the motorcycle market going to get diminished significantly? And, you know, are the margins going to get squeezed somewhat?” And all of that. I’ll go with a simple decision.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, of course your one good answer, that you simply didn’t know enough to buy the stock but you did know enough to buy the bond, is a very good response.

The other side to that is, after all, we are a fiduciary for a lot of people, including people with permanent injuries and et cetera, et cetera. And to some extent, we are constrained by how aggressively we buy stocks versus something else. And you mix those together, why, you get our investment policy.

I think, generally speaking, you raise a very good question. I think very often, when you’re looking at a distress situation and buy the bonds, you should have bought the stock. So I think you’re looking in a promising area.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Ben Graham wrote about that in 1934, actually, in “Security Analysis,” that in the analysis of senior securities, the junior securities usually do better, but you may sleep better with the senior securities.

And we, as Charlie points out, we have 60 billion of liabilities to people in our insurance operation that, in some cases, extend out for 50 years or more.

And we would never have all of our money in stocks. I mean, we might have very significant amounts, but we are running this place so that it can stand anything.

And a couple years ago, we felt very good about where that philosophy left us.

I mean, we actually could do things at a time when most people were paralyzed, and we’ll keep running it that way.

**17. Creating a good corporate culture is easier than changing a bad one**

WARREN BUFFETT: Area 6.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett, thanks for having us here.

I recently joined a new organization and for me to succeed there, the culture of the organization needs to change.

So I’m interested in hearing your thoughts about how do you change culture of an organization? And if you’re building a new organization, then how do you make sure you have a strong and unique culture?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I think it’s a lot easier to build a new organization around a culture than it is to change the culture of an existing organization. It is really tough. And I like that fact, in the sense of Berkshire.

I mean, it would be very tough to change the culture of Berkshire. It’s so ingrained in all our managers, our owners. Everything about the place is designed, in effect, to reinforce a culture.

And for anybody to come in and try and change it very much, I think the culture would basically reject it.

And the problem you describe, if you want to walk into, you know, whatever kind of organization you want to name — I’ve got to be a little careful here — it is tough to change cultures.

Charlie and I have bucked up against that a few times. And I would say if you have any choice in the matter, I would much rather start from scratch and build it around it.

But that was the — I’ve had the luxury of time with Berkshire. I mean, it goes back to 1965, and there really wasn’t much of anything there, you know, except some textile miles, so I didn’t have to fight anything.

And as we added companies, they became complementary and they bought into something that they felt good about, but it took decades.

And, you know, at Salomon, I attempted to change the culture, in terms of some respects, and I would not grade myself A+ in terms of the result.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I’m quite flattered that a man would say that he’s in a new place where he can’t succeed unless he changes the culture and he wants us to tell him how to change the culture.

In your position, my failure rate has been 100 percent. (Laughter) And —

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, Charlie started a law firm. Go back to, what, 1962, Charlie, what was it?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. I can move out but I couldn’t change the culture. (Laughs)

WARREN BUFFETT: We can tell some interesting stories from the old law firm, but we’ll go on to Carol now.

**18. Ajit Jain can’t be replaced**

CAROL LOOMIS: This question is from Jon Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff in New York City.

“You have emphasized many times how important Ajit Jain is to Berkshire and National Indemnities reinsurance operations. So I’m wondering whether you expect National Indemnities’ float to continue to grow or instead to unwind after he retires?”

Well, of course we don’t think —

WARREN BUFFETT: No.

CAROL LOOMIS: — Ajit will retire.

“Another way of asking that is whether National Indemnity has competitive advantages beyond Ajit, or is all of its value, above book value, tied up in Ajit and the runoff profits from the deals he has already put on the books?”

WARREN BUFFETT: His operation has competitive advantages that go beyond Ajit, but they have been developed by Ajit, and he has maximized them, and he knows how to use them in a way that’s far better, in my view, than anyone else in the world could.

But they don’t all go away. I mean, he has a cadre of about 30 people who are schooled in it, you know, in a way that would make the Jesuits look quite liberal, in terms of what they let their membership do.

Ajit — you can’t imagine a more disciplined operation than Ajit has. But Ajit cannot be replaced. On the other hand — well, I’ll state that absolutely, categorically — it would be a huge loss to Berkshire if anything happened to Ajit.

But it would not mean that the Berkshire Hathaway reinsurance operation would not continue to be an extremely special place that would do large deals that nobody else would do, that could think and act quickly in ways that virtually no other insurance organization can.

We’ve got something very special in that unit, and then we’ve got the most special of leaders in Ajit.

As to our float, every year I think our float has peaked. I never see how we can add to it. It’s up to 60 billion-plus now. And we have things like the Equitas deal that are runoffs.

Every day, in insurance, some of the float runs off, it’s just that we add additional amounts. And like I say, I was ready to quit, you know, at 20 billion and think, you know, that we’d reached the apex of it.

But it’s over 60 billion. Things keep happening.

Berkshire has become, in my view, the premiere insurance organization of the world, and we’ve got — a lot of good things come from that.

I don’t see how, with 60-odd billion of float, I don’t see how we can increase it significantly unless we would make some very significant acquisition. And I don’t rule that out, but there’s nothing imminent on that.

But we will not organically grow the float of Berkshire at a fast clip from here. It can’t be done. And we may fight to stay even.

But we may come up with something out of the blue. I mean, who would have known that Equitas was going to come along three years ago? There are various things that could happen of a positive nature.

But when I tell you about the value that Ajit has added to Berkshire, believe me, if anything, I’ve understated it.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I agree with you, and I’ve got nothing to add.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well. (Laughter)

**19. Opportunities in India, but government paralysis is a deterrent**

WARREN BUFFETT: In that case, we’ll go to number 7. Here we are.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good morning, Warren and Uncle Charlie. I have to call you Uncle because my parents are from India and we call anybody older than us Uncle or Auntie.

WARREN BUFFETT: You may have to call us great uncle. (Laughter)

SABRINA CHOOG: I’m Sabrina Choog (PH) from Los Angeles and I’m 12 years old.

My mom owns a bunch of Berkies, which obviously I’m gonna get one day. (Laughter)

My question is, 17 percent of the world is Indian. That’s one of six people in the world.

India’s economy has been growing at 7-8 percent per year. At this rate, it will surpass total U.S. GDP in 2043.

Can you please tell me why aren’t you investing in India?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it’s a good question — (applause) — and we have connections there, obviously.

But it hasn’t — in the insurance field, there have been very distinct limitations on what a non-Indian company — a non-Indian-owned company — can do.

We’ve looked a lot, mostly through Ajit. We’ve looked a lot at the possibility of being in the insurance business there.

And actually, as of yesterday, I agreed next March to go to India because our ISCAR business — (applause) — is doing very well there.

But, I don’t know what they think I can do additionally, but in any event they said, “Come on to India in March and see if we can’t expand it substantially.”

India is going to grow dramatically, and ISCAR belongs in every industrial country in the world. I mean, we are very basic to industry, and we’ve done wonders for our customers all over the world.

And we have a good-sized operation in India. But ISCAR management hopes that if we take a trip over there in March, we might land a few more accounts.

We do not rule out India, believe me, in looking at either direct investments or marketable securities.

In fact, POSCO, Charlie can describe the POSCO situation better than I, but they have big plans for India.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, the one trouble that India presents is that its governments tend to have a fair amount of paralysis, endless due process, endless objection. Zoning is hard, planning permissions are hard, et cetera.

And that has caused the very wise founder of modern Singapore to say that China is going to grow much faster than India, because their government causes less paralysis.

So these countries are different in the opportunities they present.

But of course we like India, and we — kind of admire the democracy that causes the paralysis, but we still don’t like the paralysis.

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s not ordained, however. You know, if you’d looked at China 40 years ago, you wouldn’t have dreamt of what would happen.

So countries do learn from each other, I mean, and they should. I mean, I think they’ve learned many things from the U.S. that they adapt — I’m not talking about India specifically, I’m talking about other countries generally.

They don’t take on everything we have. But if you looked at a country that was as successful as this country has been over a couple hundred years, you might figure that there could be a few good ideas you could steal.

And I think that you’re seeing that around the world, and maybe they can improve on us.

So I don’t think I would feel that any impediments to growth that existed now are necessarily ones that have to be permanent. Indian — we ought to figure out a lot of ways to do business in those countries.

My preference is, obviously, in something like insurance, which I understand, and where we’ve got terrific people. Both China and India do limit us right now quite significantly in what we can own of a company.

And I really hate to take some of our managerial talent and put them to work for something we only own 25 percent of. I’d rather have them working on something we own 100 percent of.

So it will depend on the laws. But people in India are going to be living a lot better 20 years from now than they are now, as they are in China, and as they are in the United States.

**20. “Prospects for significant inflation have increased”**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, Becky.

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from Jonathan Marsh (PH) in Sydney, Australia.

He says, “Many shareholder letters in the 1970s and 1980s discussed various aspects of inflation and its potentially destructive effects on investment.

“The 2008 letter mentioned the current Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing could again bring about inflation, yet the 2009 letter made no mention of this threat.

“What are your current thoughts on the risk level of higher inflation in the United States?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I may be a little biased on this because I’ve always worried a lot about inflation, and there’s been a lot of inflation.

You know, Charlie’s pointed out, you know, since I was born in 1930, the dollar’s depreciated by well over 90 percent. But as he also points out, we’ve done OK. So it isn’t the end of the world, necessarily.

I think that the prospects for significant inflation have increased, you know, with what — not only here, but around the world, with the situation that governments have either been forced into or elected to embrace.

And they may well have been the correct responses, but we may find that weaning ourselves from the medicine was harder than solving the original illness. And the medicine, you know, has been massive dosages of debt. And, like I say, not only here, but elsewhere.

And I don’t see any way that countries running very high deficits, relative to GDP, don’t have a significant diminution in the value of their currency over time.

Now, it could be done for a while. I mean, we’ve done it through wars and everything else, and maybe we will correct the situation.

But if we don’t, I wrote an op-ed piece in The New York Times about a year ago on this.

And I do think that if you wanted to bet on higher or lower inflation, bet your life on it, I’d bet on higher, and maybe a lot higher.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, again, I agree. (Laughter)

**21. Munger: McDonald’s is better educator than universities**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, number 8.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Lucas Rineswell (PH) and I’m from Whangerei. And in case you don’t know where Whangarei is, it’s in New Zealand.

At the moment, it’s quarter past 4 in the morning in New Zealand, so I’d be safe to say that my wife will be sound asleep.

So I’m an idealist. What can be done to educate the children about the sage of Omaha’s philosophy of successful money management, and to prevent another reoccurrence of the financial mayhem that we’ve all seen and experienced in the 2007 and 2008 years?

WARREN BUFFETT: We will see financial mayhem, as you put it, from time to time. I hope we reduce it, I hope we reduce the magnitude, et cetera.

But people do crazy things, and it’s not a function of IQ, and sometimes it’s not a function of education.

In fact, I would argue that some of the problems, and not a small part of what’s occurred in the last 30 years, has been because of what became the prevailing conventional wisdom in the leading business schools.

So, I’m not particularly positive about modifying the madness of mankind from time to time.

The first part though, however, is the kind of thing in our movie. I really do believe that getting good financial habits — other kinds of habits, too, but what I’m thinking about here is primarily financial habits — getting those early in life is enormously important.

I mean, Charlie and I were probably lucky that we grew up in households where we were getting all kinds of unspoken lessons, even, in terms of how to handle our life, but in particular, how to handle finances.

And not everybody gets that. And Andy Heyward, who did a terrific job with “Liberty’s Kids” in teaching about the history of America three or four years ago, has come up with this idea of “The Secret Millionaires Club.”

And if we get through to 2 or 3 percent, or 5 percent, or whatever it may be, of the kids, in terms of giving them some ideas they might not otherwise have, and they build some habits around it, you know, it isn’t going to change the world, but it could be a plus in their lives.

It’s very important to get the financial habits. And really, Charlie’s a big fan, and so am I, of Ben Franklin’s. And he was teaching those habits a couple hundred years ago. So we’re just going to try and take Ben Franklin’s ideas and make them entertaining for children’s stories, in effect.

And I think that’s about what you should be doing. I don’t think — I think it’s much more important to have good learning at the elementary level than, frankly, to have it in terms of advanced degrees and graduate schools.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, there are other great educational institutions in America to help handle this problem. One of the ones I admire most is McDonald’s.

I had fun once at a major university when I said I thought McDonald’s succeeded better as an educator than the people in the university did.

And what I meant was McDonald’s hires a lot of people who are quite marginal at the very start of their working career. And they learn to show up on time for work and observe the discipline.

A lot of them go on in employment to much higher jobs. And they’ve had an enormous constructive effect about educating into responsibility a lot of people who were threatened with not making it.

So I think we all owe a lot to the employment culture of McDonald’s. And it’s not enough appreciated.

WARREN BUFFETT: I learned a lot from a paper manager at The Washington Times-Herald named John Daley (PH).

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

WARREN BUFFETT: And probably 13 years old or 14 years old, and I was lucky to run into him.

Basically, my life would have been somewhat different if I didn’t get those lessons from a guy that taught them to me in a very enjoyable manner. He wasn’t preaching them to me, he just told me I’d do better if I did this and that, and it worked.

So you’re lucky if you’ve got the parents to teach you that. But anything that brings it into a broader teaching environment, I’m for.

And like I say, I really think Andy has got a terrific project in this and we’ll see how it goes.

**22. Giving away everything is a “terrific tax dodge”**

WARREN BUFFETT: And speaking of Andrews or Andys, Andrew? (Laughs)

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: So we received about a dozen questions, at least I did, on the subject of your taxes, Mr. Buffett, from shareholders no less. And I chose what I hope is the most polite version of the question.

WARREN BUFFETT: I hope so, too. (Laughter)

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This one came from Tom Cornfeld (PH).

And he says, “Mr. Buffett is often quoted as saying that his assistant pays at a higher tax rate than he does, because of the disparity between the long-term capital gain and ordinary income tax rates.

“The implication is that taxes should be much higher on people like himself.

“However, I note that Mr. Buffett has donated virtually 100 percent of his estate to charitable organizations. Because he has owned his Berkshire shares for many, many years with no dividend distributions, it is virtually certain that the bulk of his estate will therefore never be subject to taxation by the U.S. government.

“My question is that, if Mr. Buffett feels that he should pay more taxes, how should the tax system be changed?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you could have a wealth tax, would be one way. I mean, you could tax — I don’t know how many countries do that now, Charlie.

In effect, you have that with a property tax in certain ways, but you could have a wealth tax. I would say this: he is absolutely correct. If you want to give away all of your money, it’s a terrific tax dodge. (Laughs)

Although, I will say this also. In the tax return I just filed, on the “charitable contributions” line, I have an unused carry-forward of something over $7 billion that I haven’t gotten a deduction for. (Laughter)

But I welcome the questioner or anybody else following my tax dodge example and giving away their money. They will save a lot of taxes that way, and the money will probably do a lot of good. (Laughs) (Applause)

Taxes — if we continue to spend 25 percent or 26 percent of GDP, as a country, and we made those elections through our representatives, we are not going to be able to keep taxation at 15 percent of GDP.

Now, we’ve got a deficit commission. You couldn’t have two better guys than Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson heading it. You have got two classy individuals there. They’re smart, they’re decent. People like to work with them. I mean, the president made a great choice in picking those two.

But in the end, they’re either going to — they’re going to have to recommend, and it will be some combination of taxes quite a bit higher, and expenditures quite a bit lower, and then they won’t be quite as popular as they are today.

And I doubt very much if you’re going to be able to increase taxes significantly as a percentage of GDP and do it, essentially, from taxing lower income people a higher amount. So it’s going to be an interesting equation to solve and I wish them the very best. They’re two terrific fellows.

Charlie, what do you have to say about taxes?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I think those who worry about your unfairly low taxes should be consoled by the fact that eventually you pay 100 percent. When you die and they ask, “How much did old Warren leave?” the answer will be, “I believe he left it all.”

WARREN BUFFETT: And I hope they emphasize old. (Laughter)

No, it’s kind of interesting. I mean, just take Berkshire. You know, essentially, I will never sell a share of Berkshire.

But I’ve known that for a long, long, long time. So basically, that’s fine.

If I was a trustee for some trust and they owned Berkshire, which, in effect, I am, you know, it’s a lot of fun to run and everything. And I’ve got everything in life I could possibly need, and I always will.

And, you know, in the end, because Berkshire’s done well, we can give away the rest.

Now, if you want, you can argue that if I gave it all to the federal government instead of giving it to the charities, society would be better off, but I don’t think many of you would want to hold that position. (Laughter)

**23. The best defense against inflation**

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 9. (Applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello.

WARREN BUFFETT: Hi.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett, my name is Jeff Chen (PH) from San Francisco.

I wanted to ask you a little bit more detail about the inflation question, wanted to know what are the key metrics you look at when you evaluate future inflation and your valuation methodology?

And what are some of the catalysts that’s going to cause the inflation to rise in the future?

WARREN BUFFETT: You give me credit for more brain power than I actually bring to the question.

I don’t think you can look at any given metric in any given month and figure out exactly what that’s going to do to inflation rates because, so much — if it gets going so much, it creates its own dynamic.

You know, we saw that in the late 1970s and early 1980s until Volcker came along with a sledgehammer to the economy.

But we had people running from money at that time, and, of course, we got the prime rate up to 21-and-a-fraction percent, and we got governments up to very close to 15 percent.

So we had a little demonstration project 30 years ago in this country of what happens when people get fearful about money.

And if we were to continue the policies we have now, I would think something — a rerun of that, you know, could be fairly likely.

But, you know, trend is not destiny. We have the power to do things, and Congress has the power. And that’s why I wrote that op-ed piece a year ago, to sort of flash a yellow light.

We have the power to control our future, and we do it through elected representatives.

I will just go back to the conclusion that, based on what I see happening, American people, government around the world, I think currencies are a poorer bet than they have been for some time. But I have no idea what that means in terms of rates of inflation. And I hope I’m wrong on it.

I would say if inflation ever really gets in the saddle, that it gets very unpredictable as to how fast it can accelerate and how faith in institutions can break down. A lot of things — a lot of bad things could happen with it.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. The best defense, of course, is to contribute as much as you can to the civilization and expect to counter inflation’s effects by your own merits.

That’s the safest antidote. The idea that just by outsmarting other people you can somehow profit from the inflation is a much more dangerous course of action.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Your money can be inflated away but your talent can’t be inflated away. If you’re the best brain surgeon in Omaha, or the best painter, or whatever it may be, you will always command your share of the resources around you, you know, whether the currency is seashells or $10 million notes, or whatever it may be.

Talent is a terrific asset to deal with any kind of a monetary situation. But Charlie and I have to fall back on money.

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol? (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Too late for talent.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

**24. Problems at NetJets**

CAROL LOOMIS: This question comes from Douglas Ott of Banyan Capital Management in Atlanta.

“In your recent letter to shareholders, you wrote that it was clear you failed us in letting NetJets descend into such a condition that it has recorded an aggregate pre-tax loss over the 11 years we have owned the company.

“What specifically were the errors committed by you and the previous CEO? What have you learned? And how will you prevent such a thing from happening with any of our other businesses in the future?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I probably won’t. (Laughs)

We’ll make mistakes from time to time, and some of our managers may make mistakes. And sometimes you run into conditions that are really extraordinary.

But the mistake, the biggest mistake made with NetJets is essentially we kept — we were buying planes at prices that were fictitious, in terms of the price at which we would later be able to sell them. And there’s a certain time lapse involved in buying fractional shares.

There’s a lot of explanations for it. But in the end, we didn’t properly prepare for what was obviously happening. And we lost a lot of money, a good bit of which was attributable to the write-down of planes, which you could call is our inventory, where we bought them at X and we couldn’t sell them at X or 90 percent of X.

Some of those were new planes that we should not have taken on, and many of them were planes coming back from owners.

We also let our operating costs get out of line with recurring revenues.

But, you know, I’ve made plenty of mistakes. I stayed in the textile business for 20 years. I knew it was a lousy business. Charlie was telling me it was a lousy business in the first year, the second year.

And 20 years later, I woke up. I was like Rip Van Winkle. I mean, it’s kind of depressing when you think about it. (Laughter)

But the one thing we will guarantee, we’ll make some mistakes. It was a big mistake at NetJets, $711 million is the figure.

We are now operating at NetJets at a very decent profit. The figures you saw there on the screen reflect a pretax profit of well over $50 million in the first quarter, and that’s not with any big boom in plane sales or anything else. It’s just with a business plan that involves not an iota of diminution of safety or service, but just got things in line that needed to be in line.

And I give Dave Sokol enormous credit. I mean, he turned that place around like nobody could have, and all the shareholders here owe him a big vote of thanks for that.

Charlie? (Applause)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes, but I believe that the episode ought to be reviewed in context.

If we buy 30 big businesses and generally let the people who run them successfully and before run them with very little interference from headquarters, and it works out 95 percent of the time very well, and we have one episode when the basic franchise was protected but we lost profit opportunities for a while, it’s not a big failure record.

Nor does it indicate that we should stop being pretty easy with the remarkable people who join us with their companies.

WARREN BUFFETT: No, it does not change our management approach at all. I think that we have gotten performance, overall, from managers that are beyond the dreams I would have had when I was first putting this company together.

So, it’s been a — we let managers do their stuff. And I think —

CHARLIE MUNGER: It’s worked for us, net.

WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, it’s worked — it’s worked very well for us, net. And we’re going to keep doing it.

**25. BYD investment shows the “old men” are still learning**

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 10.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. This is Eric Chang from Beijing, China.

First, thanks for the occasion for us to engage with you like this, and also for inspiring young people to learn. Mr. Munger has described you as an incredible learning machine in terms of learning new areas, and expanding your circle of competence.

So I would like to understand is if you can make it more concrete, recently you make investment in BYD, a company in China that makes batteries and also electric cars which are, arguably, technology companies.

So can you sort of go through that example and see how you sort of like analyzed the case and asked questions that helped you make a decision to invest in such a company? Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie deserves 100 percent of the credit for BYD, so I’m going to let him answer that.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, it’s an interesting example because Berkshire would not have made an investment in BYD if the opportunity had come along five or 10 years earlier. And it shows that the old men are continuing to learn, and that’s absolutely essential.

Berkshire would have a lower potential than it does if we had stayed the way we were. And — so you are absolutely right in calling attention to this episode.

Again, Dave Sokol helped. I wasn’t at all sure I could get Warren to do this all by myself so I inveigled Dave into going over to China, and the two of us were able to help the learning process. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Well put. Well put.

**26. Why we will never hire a compensation consultant**

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from Mark Wares (PH) and it has to do with Berkshire’s compensation.

He says, “How does Berkshire structure the performance based-compensation of the CEOs of its subsidiaries? Please because as specific as you can regarding the metrics on which you focus the most, and how the degree to which those are attained translates into compensation.”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, well, the first thing we do is we never engage a compensation consultant. (Applause)

And we have, whatever it may be, 70-plus or whatever number businesses we have.

They have very different economic characteristics. To try to set some Berkshire standard to apply to businesses such as insurance, which has capital as a bulwark but which we get to invest in other things we’d invest in anyway, so there’s minus capital involved, to a BNSF or our utility business where there’s tons of capital involved, or in between See’s where there is very little capital involved.

We have other businesses that are basically just so damn good that a, you know, a chimpanzee could run them, and we have other business that are so tough at times that, you know, if we had Alfred P. Sloan back, you know, we wouldn’t be able to do very well with them.

So there’s enormous differences in the economic characteristics of our business.

I try to figure out what — if I owned the whole business — what is a sensible way to employ somebody and compensate them, considering the economic characteristics of the business. So we have all kinds of different plans.

It doesn’t take a couple of hours of my time a year to do it. We have managers who stay with us, so they must be reasonably happy with the plans.

And, you know, it is not rocket science, but it does require — it requires the ability to differentiate.

If we had a human relations department, it would be a disaster. They would be attending conferences and people would be telling them all these different things to put in equations and so on. It just requires a certain amount of common sense.

And it requires, incidentally, an interaction with the managers where, you know, I listen to them, they listen to me, and we sort of agree on what really is the measure of what they’re actually adding to the company.

And — what do you — what do you say to that, Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I think the U.S. Army and General Electric have centralized personnel policies that probably work best for them, and we have just the opposite system, and I think it clearly works best for us.

And practically nobody else is entirely like us, which makes us very peculiar. And I like it that way, don’t you?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we really like it that way. We get worried when people agree with us. (Laughter)

We pay people — we pay some very big money. We have managers that have made and will make in the tens of millions annually, and we have managers that, you know, when we suffer, they suffer.

But you’ve got to treat people fairly. Even though they don’t need the money, everybody wants to be treated fairly.

And so the rationale for how you’re doing it should be understood, but there is no cross-Berkshire rationale at all. I mean, if you run See’s Candy, to put a cost of capital factor in or something like that, what the consultant would tell you, it’s nonsense.

It isn’t going to make any difference whether there’s 40 million or 43 million or 37 million of capital in the business.

The main thing to do is, in terms of market position and all that sort of thing, the real thing I really want to pay managers for is widening the moat that separates our business from our competitors’ businesses over time. Now, that gets very subjective, so I don’t have any perfect way of doing that. But that is always going through my mind in trying to design compensation systems.

So far, like I say, I don’t think — I can’t — can you recall any manager that’s ever left us over compensation, Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I think it’s amazing how simple it’s been and how little time it has taken and how well it has worked.

There’s this idea that headquarters can do these wonderful things. Headquarters, in a conglomerate kind of a company, is frequently hated in the field. We don’t want to be hated in the field. We don’t want an imperial headquarters with big costs that’s imposed everywhere.

And averaged out, it’s worked wonderfully well for us.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we make no headquarters charges. We charge for our credit with a couple of companies, but — most companies are allocating a couple percent of sales, maybe, or whatever it might be, to all their different operations. And usually it’s resented out in the field. And —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Is it ever.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. So we don’t do it.

**27. “We won’t trade reputation for money”**

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 11.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. My name is Joe Bob Hitchcock. I’m a winemaker from the Napa Valley in California.

I would like to suggest that the next time you and Charlie have a steak at Gorat’s that you accompany it with a new health food, a Napa Valley red wine. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: We just went in the wine distribution business, as you may know. (Laughs)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Excellent.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Warren is helpless, but I’m with you.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: OK. (Laughter)

I’ll send you a bottle.

One of the keys to the success of Berkshire is your policy to allow the managers of the various Berkshire Hathaway companies to operate with minimal interference from Omaha.

But if you became aware of unethical or illegal activities at a Berkshire Hathaway-owned company, would you directly and personally intervene?

WARREN BUFFETT: Sure. We have to jump in.

We have a hotline, which I think was a very good invention of — it wasn’t an invention, but a good policy embodied in Sarbanes-Oxley. And, you know, that’s been a plus to us. I get letters directly sometimes.

So I want to hear about problems. I hope somebody else has heard about them first and already gotten them solved, but if they don’t get solved someplace else, I want to hear about them.

And we have an internal audit function, which is important at Berkshire. And anything that comes in, you know, when somebody calls in on the complaint line and says, “The guy works next to me has bad breath,” I tend to skip over those.

But if anything comes in that relates to alleged bad behavior, it’s going to get investigated at Berkshire. And it does.

And every now and then, there have been some important transgressions that have come to us via either letters to me, or calls on the hotline, or maybe letters to the audit committee, whatever. We encourage that.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. We care more about that than business mistakes, way more.

WARREN BUFFETT: We have a letter that goes out every roughly two years; it’s the only communication. I probably ought to put a copy of it in the annual report sometime so that the shareholders see it.

But it’s a page and a half long. It asks the manager to tell me who, if something happened to them that night, who I should consider putting in charge of the place the next day.

Doesn’t mean I’ll follow their advice, but I want to know their reasons and the pluses and minuses.

But it starts off basically and it says, “Look, we’ve got all the money we need.” We’d like to make more money. We love making money.

But we don’t have a shred more reputation than we need, and we won’t trade reputation for money.

And we want that message to get out. It’s the reason we stick that Salomon thing in the movie every year. I mean, you can — probably some of you can recite it by now, but I don’t think it can hurt to keep repeating that story.

And the one thing we tell — we tell them that message, and then I’ve added a new line in this. And I say, if the reason you’re doing something, the best reason you can come up with, is that the other guy is doing it, it’s not good enough.

There’s must be — there’s got to be some other reason besides, “The other fellow’s doing it,” or you’re in trouble. And I tell them, “Call me if anything’s questionable. You think it’s close to the line, give me a call.”

By saying that, nobody gives me a call because they — (laughs) — they know that the very fact that they think it’s that close to the line probably tells them it’s over the line.

But I want to hear about stuff. We can cure any problem if we hear about it soon enough and take action soon enough. But if it’s allowed to fester out someplace and people cover it up — and sometimes they have — then we’ve got a problem.

And we will have more of that in the future, there’s no getting around it, you know. If you have 260,000 people, there can be some things going on. I just hope we hear about them fast.

And I hope their managers hear about them even faster and do something before it even gets to us. But we want very much to protect the reputation of Berkshire. It’s the right thing to do.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, it is absolutely essential. And Berkshire, averaged out, has a very good reputation, as you can tell by the ratings from major media and surveys.

And that is absolutely precious to us. In a sense, you people are part of the culture, too.

The ideal is not to just make all the money that can be legally be made without causing too much legal trouble. The idea is bigger than that. It’s that we celebrate wealth only when it’s been fairly won and wisely used.

And if that idea pervades the culture of a place, including the shareholders, we think that’s very helpful to us. (Applause)

**28. BNSF has benefitted from good regulations**

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question relates to your investment in Burlington Northern, and it comes from Josh Sanbules (PH), who I believe is in New York City.

And he asks, “You mention in your annual letter that regulators of the railroad industry need to provide, quote, ‘certainty about allowable returns,’ unquote, in order to make huge investments. If you were going to help the regulators calculate, quote, ‘allowable returns,’ how would you suggest they do it?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I think the Service Transportation Board — and maybe Matt Rose could help give more details — but I think they’ve adopted something like 10 1/2 percent, or thereabouts, on invested capital.

And if you had a major enough change in interest rates or something, you could argue that there should be some adjustment, perhaps, in one direction or another.

Usually, in the case of regulated utilities, they talk about return on equity. And you have different amounts in different states, but some states it may be 11 percent, in some states it may be 12 percent or something like that. It’s usually in that range.

With the railroads, they’ve gone toward this return on invested capital, which includes debt as an adjusted figure.

And I don’t think that’s a crazy, crazy standard. I mean, the railroad, unlike the electric utility, when you get an allowed return in the electric utility you’re almost certain of earning it, I mean, if you behave yourself. And your demand is never going to fall off that much, probably, that you’ll go way below your return.

The railroad’s got more downside in it if you run into a terrific industrial recession, so you’re not as protected on the downside.

But there should be some figure, and I would argue that the 10 1/2 percent, or whatever it may be on invested capital, that’s been achieved by the four big railroads in recent years, something close to that or right around that figure.

And you want the railroads investing a whole lot more than depreciation, and I would think that would be — it’s certainly an inducement to me to invest money in improving the transportation system.

And on the other hand, if that return were far lower than that, it would be crazy to put money, because you can’t change that railroad system and do something else with it.

So I think the country and the railroad systems have a very common interest in not earning exorbitant profits or anything like that, but getting a decent return on what is sure to be much needed investment over the next 10, 20, 30 years.

And I’d go along with — if the Service Transportation Board says 10 1/2 percent, or some number like that, I think that’s not a crazy number.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, yeah, the railroads have been a hugely successful system, in terms of a regulated business. If you stop to think about it, the railroads of America have been essentially totally rebuilt in the last 30 or 40 years.

They’ve improved the tracks, they’ve changed the size of the tunnels, they’ve improved the bridges. The average train can be more than twice as long and twice as heavy.

And you can hardly imagine a business that’s done a better job in adapting to the needs of the rest of us than the American railroad industry. And that’s by and large been a system of wise regulation accompanied by wise management. And that was not always the case.

If you go back a long time, neither the management nor the regulation was all that wise. But the existing system has worked very well for all of us.

**29. “Lumpy” earnings as competitive advantage**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, number 12.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello, my name is Ashish Texali (PH). I am from New Delhi, India.

First of all, I would like to thank Kelly Bruce (PH) and Carol from American Express to the help they’ve extended to make this event possible.

The question regarding General Re and reinsurance business.

As the insurance business uses complex models, how is Berkshire more comfortable that insurance business models are not exposing you to significant risks like the models did for Wall Street?

Also, if it is not confidential, is there concentration of risk? That is, what are those few events which can cause significant loss for insurance businesses?

WARREN BUFFETT: I’m not sure I got all of that, but we run significant risks from earthquakes. We had, in the Chilean quake — I don’t know how much would have been in the first quarter. When you read our 10-Q there will be a number in there. But we insure 20 percent of Swiss Re. We will take 20 percent of their loss from that.

We have various other exposures in something like that. We included our best estimate in those figures I put up earlier.

Our peak risks now, in terms of earthquakes or hurricanes — which are the two biggest natural catastrophes, in terms of frequency and severity — are probably down quite considerably from a few years ago, not because of any diminished appetite for risk. But we just haven’t felt that the rates were that attractive in those areas.

But if we thought the rates were attractive, we’re perfectly willing to take on a group of risks where, if something very close to worst case happened, you know, we would lose $5 billion or something like that.

We lost 3 billion-plus in Katrina. We lost well over 2 billion, I think quite a bit more than that actually, on 9/11.

There will be things come along like that. Nothing that ever remotely comes close to making us uncomfortable, though, in terms of the level. I don’t know whether I got his full question there or not, Charlie, but you —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, pretty close. I would say that the main difference between our practice and that of most other people is that we are deliberately seeking a method of operation which will give us occasional big losses in a single year, big overall losses.

And everybody else is trying to avoid that. And we just want to be rich enough so a big loss in a single year is a blip.

And that’s a competitive advantage, that willingness to endure fluctuating annual results. Big advantage, wouldn’t you say?

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s a huge advantage. It’s a huge advantage. And it’s one that no one else is going to pick up on. I mean, they know what we do, they just don’t want to do it, or they’re unable to do it, in terms of financial resources.

So, I would say that comes very close to a permanent and substantial advantage at Berkshire.

I don’t — forget about — you shouldn’t forget about it, but forget about the human suffering and all that. Just the financial consequences of a Katrina, you know, when we lose 3 billion in that, I don’t feel any different the next day than I felt the day before, financially. I mean, it just doesn’t make any difference, because we are in that particular game.

And as long as we make the right decisions over time, in terms of the premiums we get, and as long as we never expose ourselves to a loss that would really shake up our capital structure or anything, you know, that is a game in which we have a huge competitive edge. And it gets wider every year.

So, you know, risk — we are in the business — in insurance, we are in the business of taking the other guys’ desire to smooth their earnings, and, in exchange, get what we think are larger, lumpy earnings over time. We like the business.

Carol? Oh, go ahead, Charlie.

CHARLIE MUNGER: I was going to say Warren has a different position than a lot of other people in the insurance business. After a year in which Berkshire has a big loss, he can look into his shaving mirror and say, “Your shareholder still loves you.” (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: That’s right.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Other people are not in that position.

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie and I knew a guy from Omaha who, 40 or 50 years ago, was one of the richest guys in the United States, named Howard Ahmanson. And Howard had a fetish about owning 100 percent of everything that he came in contact with.

And so he said, when asked why, he said, “I like to look in the mirror and say, ‘All my shareholders love me.’” (Laughter)

And I’m not quite that extreme, but I like to look in the mirror and say, “Enough of my shareholders love me.” (Laughter)

**30. “Gambling” with derivatives**

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol.

CAROL LOOMIS: This question is about derivatives.

“What useful function do derivatives serve in our economy? We got along quite well without them for many years. If they serve no useful purpose, and in fact, have demonstrated that they can do considerable damage to the economy, why are they not made illegal, especially the naked ones? There is precedent for that.

“I believe that short selling of stocks that one does not own or has managed to borrow is illegal.”

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie has — he can get worked up more on this than I can, so I’m going to let him answer that. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I think the usefulness of derivatives has always been overrated. If we didn’t have any derivatives at all, including contracts to buy and sell grain that were traded on exchanges, we’d still have plenty of oats and wheat.

I mean, I think it is slightly more convenient for people to be able to hedge their risks of farming by using derivative markets and commodities.

And the test is not, “Is there any benefit in derivatives?” The question is, is the net benefit versus disadvantage from derivatives useful? Or would we be better off without it?

My own view is that, if we went back to having nothing but derivative trading in commodities, metals, currencies, safely conducted under responsible rules, and all other derivatives contracts vanished from the earth, it would be a better place. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: We’ll take a current example. Burlington Northern has hedged diesel fuel, which they use a lot of, over the years. And then they also have fuel adjustment clauses in a lot of their contracts for transportation.

With Matt Rose, who does a wonderful job of running Burlington, I basically say, “Look at. If I were running the place, I wouldn’t bother to hedge them,” because if you hedge it — if you hedge it for a million years, you know, you’re going to be out the frictional costs, probably, of doing it, unless you’re smarter than the market generally on diesel fuel. And if you’re smarter than the market on diesel fuel generally, we’ll go into the business of speculating on diesel fuel.

I mean, if we’ve really got an edge, you know, why bother to run the trains? Let’s just speculate diesel fuel.

But I also say, you know, they’ve got — and if you have an organization where you have somebody in charge of that activity, it’s going to take place.

On the other hand, Matt Rose has done a fabulous job, as well as his management team, in running Burlington Northern. If they are more comfortable, or they find it useful in any way, in terms of pricing contracts, or anything, to hedge it, that’s fine with me, too.

I mean, it’s his company, he can figure out the best way of running it. I’ll hold him responsible for how it does over time. And, you know, I would do it one way and somebody else would do it another way. I don’t think that’s —

I would not condemn anybody that’s running a railroad for hedging diesel fuel, nor would I condemn anybody that runs an energy company, like we do at MidAmerican, for hedging energy costs in certain ways.

But I do think, if we could put up a presentation, number 4 on the screen, please.

I think it was said very well in 1935. In fact, chapter 8 of Keynes’s General — chapter 12, I’m sorry — chapter 12 of Keynes’s “General Theory” is, by far, in my view, probably Charlie’s too, the best description of the way capital markets function, the real way people operate. It’s prescriptive, it’s descriptive.

Everybody should read chapter 12. It’s a little — it starts a little slow in the first few pages.

But Keynes — I’m going to read this because I don’t think Charlie has it in front of him.

The first part of it is very familiar to people. I mean, this quote has been used a lot. But every word in this, to me, is right on the money.

“Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.”

You can change that to “gambling” if you want to.

“When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.” That’s the famous part of the quote.

Keynes went on to say, “The measure of success attained by Wall Street, regarded as an institution of which the proper social purpose is to direct new investment into the most profitable channels in terms of future yield, cannot be claimed as one of the outstanding triumphs of laissez-faire capitalism - which is not surprising, if I am right in thinking that the best brains of Wall Street have been in fact directed towards a different object.”

That was written in 1935. I don’t think there’s been anything better written about how government, how citizens, should look at Wall Street and what it does and it doesn’t.

It’s always had this mixture of a casino operation and a very socially important operation.

And when derivatives became popular, and academia was behind them 100 percent. They were teaching more about how to value an option than they were about how to value a business. And I witnessed that and it drove me crazy.

But in 1982, Congress was considering, really, the expansion of a derivative contract to the general public in a huge, publicized way. It was the S&P 500 contract. That changed the whole derivatives game.

At that point, basically, Wall Street just said, “Come on in, and everybody can speculate in an index. Not any real company, just an index. And you can buy it at 10 o’clock in the morning and sell it at 10:01, and you’re contributing to this wonderful society by doing it.”

And I wrote a letter to Congressman Dingle, and we’ll put up exhibit 5. I just excerpted a few of the statements I made there. This was one month before they put in trading in the S&P 500, April. They put it in April, 1982, in Chicago; did a little in Kansas City first.

And I went through four pages of things and I just pulled out a few things. But I think that, to some extent, what I forecasted then has turned out to be the case.

And then it got squared and all of that, as both the people in Wall Street kept dreaming up new and new ways for people to gamble.

And as I say, academia was applauding all along the way and getting hired as consultants to various exchanges to tell them how wonderful they were, in terms of their social purpose.

I think that — well, it’s up there for you to read. I’d be glad — the whole letter was reprinted, I believe, in Fortune at one time, Carol. Was it—?

CHARLIE MUNGER: By the way, if I remember right, this was like the only letter in opposition to this uniformly acclaimed new world of better gambling in things related to securities. Warren wrote the letter —

WARREN BUFFETT: And it’s a —

CHARLIE MUNGER: — all those years ago, and it was the only letter —

WARREN BUFFETT: Incidentally —

CHARLIE MUNGER: He basically said the idea’s insane. It will do more harm than good. Then, as now, people didn’t pay that much attention to him.

WARREN BUFFETT: And I’ll venture that very few people in this room know — you all know that if you buy a stock, you have to hold it for a very long period of time to get a special capital gains treatment on it.

If you buy an S&P 500 contract at 11 o’clock and sell it at 11:01 and have a profit, it’s taxed 60 percent as a long-term capital gain, and 40 percent as short-term capital gain.

So you really get better tax treatment if you’re gambling on an S&P 500 derivative, which is what it is, in Chicago, than you do if you invest for four or five months in some security and then have to sell it for some reason.

It’s a tribute to the lobbying power of a rather small group that has done very well off this particular activity.

Charlie, can you think of any reason why it’s 60 percent long-term gain if you hold something for 30 seconds? (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, of course it’s crazy. It’s neither fair nor sensible.

But if a small group with a lot of money and influence cares a great deal about something and the rest of us are indifferent, why, they tend to win before our legislative bodies.

That’s just the way it is. I always liked Bismarck’s remark that you shouldn’t watch two things: sausage making and legislation making. (Laughter)

**31. Buffett is losing his bet against hedge funds**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, with those hopeful words — (laughter) — we’re going to break for lunch. Before we break for lunch, I made a charitable wager with a group, Protégé Partners, two years ago about the behavior of funds of funds that they would select, hedge funds, and the S&P index fund.

The duration of our wager is ten years, and whichever one loses, the money goes — well the money from both goes to the winner’s charity, is what it amounts to.

Interesting firm out on the West Coast that supervises what they call these long bets. So if we’ll put up exhibit 6, you can see at this point I’m behind.

And have we gotten exhibits? Yeah. Let’s go to lunch. OK. (Laughter)

**Afternoon session**

**1. Speak out, but speak responsibly**

WARREN BUFFETT: And I think therefore we go to 13, which is in a separate room. And is there anybody at the microphone in 13?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, there is.

WARREN BUFFETT: OK.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. This is a shareholder from New York. One could argue that a major contributor to the great bubble was that there wasn’t a healthy and open debate. That all the opinion and all of the money was on one side of the trade.

And I was thinking about this recently as I read Christine Richard’s new book, “Confidence Game,” about Bill Ackman and his battle with what was once the largest bond insurer, MBIA.

The story also reminded me of David Einhorn and the questions he raised about Allied Capital and Lehman Brothers. We now know that they were 100 percent correct, but at the time that they first spoke up they were attacked by the companies, pilloried by the media, ignored by the accountants of those firms and the rating agencies, and perhaps most alarmingly were investigated by the SEC for daring to go public with their bearish analyses.

And I can tell you that watching what happened to them, it’s a real deterrent to anyone else speaking up and raising similar questions.

So I’d be curious for your thoughts on this, and is having short sellers speak out healthy for our markets?

And in general what should be done to encourage a greater diversity of opinions so that we can avoid future bubbles? Thank you. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I don’t see anything wrong with people who are positive or negative speaking out, as long as they’re willing to be held responsible for the kind of statements they make. I mean, there are — obviously —

Well, take the extreme example. If there were two banks in town, and I owned one of them and I was of kind of a devious type of mind, I might go out and hire 50 people to stand in line in front of the other bank, and I would probably not have a competitor before long.

So you can do things on either side, the long side or the short side, that I would regard as certainly unethical and in many cases should be illegal.

But anytime you attack the conventional wisdom, you’re going to meet with a lot of opposition because you’re threatening people’s positions.

When we would talk about the efficient market theory 30 years ago when it was absolutely de rigueur that — and virtually every finance department in the country, major schools, you either had to swear allegiance to it or you were not going to be promoted.

You know, people don’t like that. And any institution, when they get a threat from the outside, they will attack both the threat and the threatener.

But that exists on both sides. I have no problem with short selling, and I have no problem with speaking out responsibly about your reasons for doing so, any more than I have on the long side.

There have been some very bad practices on the short side, and there have been some very bad practices on the long side, in terms of people trying to literally spread things that are untrue.

But that has probably been more on the long side over the years than on the short side, by some margin.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, I think to some extent you’re criticizing the wrong people. In many cases, the accountants that allowed the lousy accounting are the ones that ought to be held in the dock. And they get very little criticism in America and that’s a mistake.

**2. Why there’s no synergy among subsidiaries**

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky? (Applause)

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from Ben Soh (PH) who lives in the metro Vancouver area in British Columbia, Canada. This is for either Mr. Buffett or Mr. Munger.

He wants to know about synergies at Berkshire, specifically, “Does it make sense that the Dairy Queen stores here sell PepsiCo products and would not expect — accept — American Express, only Mastercard or Visa? (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: There are — around the world, there are pretty close to 6,000 Dairy Queen outlets of one sort or another. And some are called Grill and Chill now, different things, but roughly 6,000, and company-operated are 70 of those.

So almost 99 percent are franchised, and at Dairy Queen we do not control what the franchisees do. Most of the franchisees — last time I checked sometime back — but most of the franchisees serve Coke, the enlightened ones — (laughter) — but it is entirely their business.

They can — they can — they can serve Coca-Cola products or Pepsi. It seems some of the other franchise operations seem to have more control over that than Dairy Queen.

But if you think about it, Dairy Queen goes back before McDonald’s, before Wendy’s, before Burger King, before Kentucky Fried, all of those. It goes way back into the ’30s, and a lot of the agreements with franchisees were territorial operators were done on the back of a napkin, or something of the sort.

So to some extent we have less control over what franchisees do, particular in certain — a few parts of the country — than other people.

But we’ll — keep asking for Coke, and maybe you can cause them to see the light. The synergies, any synergies, any synergies at Berkshire come about at the operational level pretty much.

We do not tell our companies to do business with each other. We hope they do do business with each other, and, you know, and we hope that each side of a subsidiary A offers good reasons for subsidiary B to do business with them.

But the whole idea at Berkshire is that our managers are responsible for their businesses, and if they’re going to be responsible for their businesses it means we shouldn’t tell them what to do, except in very limited ways.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, you’ve accurately described the way it is. What’s interesting about it is we really like it that way. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s a lot less work. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes.

WARREN BUFFETT: And I think, actually, that there’s some merit. Sometimes people work better together if it’s their decision to work together than if you tell them to work together.

CHARLIE MUNGER: It goes beyond that. Warren and I would like it that way if we were in the subsidiaries. There’s no doubt about that.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we’d probably leave if it wasn’t that way. (Laughs)

**3. Act as if “you were an owner of the place”**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Area 1.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Dear Mr. Buffett, dear Mr. Munger, my name is Steven Roman (PH). I’m a student of engineering maschinenbau at the University of Vienna in Austria.

If I one day want to apply as a manager with one of the Berkshire companies, what qualities are you especially looking for? And what do I have to do to become your successor? (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Probably shoot me. (Laughter)

The managers of our subsidiaries hire their own people. The number of decisions I have to make about managers are really, really few.

As I mentioned earlier, they do send me a letter that if something happens to them, gives me their ideas about who should succeed them.

But I make no decisions about who gets hired at GEICO, or Burlington, or Mid-American or anything of the sort. I mean, if they need a CFO they go out and hire a CFO, or if they need somebody to run a plant they go out and hire them themselves.

They are responsible for their operations, and occasionally we have a death, we have an occasional — very occasional, I can’t even hardly think of one — resignation.

And at that point I have to make a decision about who should be put in charge of the operation. But I don’t think I’ve had more than 10 or 12 of those in 45 years.

So I’m not a very good employment agency. We have 21 people, I think it is, at headquarters, and I made a terrific hire here a few months ago. But that’ll take care of me for four or five years.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, there’s no indication we’d be particularly good at it, either. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. I wasn’t going to mention that. (Laughter)

But I would say this: if you want — what is interesting to me is that when you find somebody outstanding, boy, do they jump out. I mean, somebody that is thinking about the place the right way, is working extra hard, whatever it may be.

There aren’t — you don’t have that much competition in this world. So, in terms of generally advancing within organizations, I think you’d be surprised at how little competition you really have if you start thinking like you would if you were an owner of the place, and working like you would if you were an owner of the place, and pretty soon you may be running something.

**4. Retained earnings, present value, and dividends**

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question comes from Tomer Malon (PH) from Tel Aviv, Israel. And he has clearly been a long-time shareholder because he references your 1984 Chairman Letter.

He writes, “You have previously stated that a company should retain its earnings only if, quote, ‘For every dollar retained, at least one dollar of market value will be created for owners,’ unquote.

“You also noted that if such conditions will no longer apply to Berkshire, as measured on the basis of a five-year rolling average, then quote, ‘We will distribute all unrestricted earnings that we believe cannot be effectively used.’

“However, during the five-year period between July third — I’m sorry, January 3rd, 2005 and December 31st, 2009, the average annual earnings per share for class A, as reported, amounted to $5,930, while at the same period the average annual change in the share’s market price was only $2,420.

“Consequently, are you considering a distribution of a dividend or buying back shares? I imagine I know the answer, but I thought we had to ask.” (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, he does know the answer, but we’ll elaborate.

I did write that, not only in 1984 but continuously in the back of the Berkshire annual report where I’ve got our economic principles.

And frankly, the way I wrote that the first time was not well thought out. And in the 2009 annual report, partly because somebody asked that question last year, I actually rewrote that section.

And I pointed out that even when I wrote it in 1984, we would have flunked the test in many previous years when, generally speaking, the stock market had suffered a significant decline over a period of time.

As you can tell by looking at our report, right now every dollar that we have left in the business, you know, has produced, in present value terms, something over $1.30 of market value.

We have met the test of retained earnings proving their worth. But the way I phrased that originally, anytime the stock market went down a whole lot in a five-year period, because we were carrying our Coca-Cola at a certain price five years earlier or whatever it was that entered into our asset value, we could have done a great job of allocating capital in the five-year period and we still would have looked bad.

And similarly if the stock market had gone up a whole lot, we could have done a dumb job and looked good.

So, if you will look in the back of the 2009 annual report, I think it’s number 11, or — I’m not sure about that.

But read the economic principles. You’ll see that I had to confess my error in how I originally worded that.

But I think it is still intellectually honest, in terms of meeting what I intended to say.

You know, I voted against this before I voted for it, or something like John Kerry said in 2004. (Laughs)

I think it does meet the test of a dollar retained earnings producing more than a dollar of market value. And we will continue to measure ourselves based on whether we meet that test.

If we don’t — if keeping a buck doesn’t produce more than a buck in present value, I don’t mean every day or every week, but over time, we should figure out something else to do.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I like people that parse through a long series of documents and find an error and rub my nose in it, particularly when it’s your error.

WARREN BUFFETT: Rub my nose in it. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, yeah.

WARREN BUFFETT: How tolerant. (Laughter)

I should have had him word it originally. Actually I think those were his words. It’s just coming back to me. (Laughter)

**5. Safety net needed for the unemployed, but Berkshire isn’t it**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Number 2.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Glen Molinar (PH) from Cleveland, Ohio. It’s been on my bucket list to come meet you, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, so it’s a privilege to be here.

My question has to do with hope and jobs. You know, in America, I think we need to figure out how we can go about creating jobs. I have been trying to help people get jobs.

My question is, and a challenge maybe, how can we get Berkshire Hathaway and your board to maybe go out and just basically hire people to give them hope?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we will hire people when we have something for them to do. (Applause)

But — and we are actually, net, hiring people now.

I mean, when the Burlington is carrying 173,000 cars a week like last week, as opposed to some time back 155,000, we need more people. And we need more people at some of our other businesses.

But our carpet business, we are down 6,000 people-plus from our peak. But people aren’t going to quit buying carpet forever. And we will be hiring a number of people, but there’s no sense hiring them when they’re not — when there’s nothing for them to do.

I went through a period, particularly, it was dramatic to me, because we owned — Berkshire Hathaway owned — a couple of textile mills, one of them in New Bedford.

And eventually we had to close those mills after we tried for 20 years to make them work.

And if you get somebody that’s working in a textile mill and they’re 55 years old, and in many cases still were speaking Portuguese, you know, retraining doesn’t mean much to them.

I mean, you need — if you believe in creative destruction and you believe in capitalism, essentially figuring out ways to do the same things with less and less people, you better have a social safety net.

And we’ve got a pretty good one in this country, a whole lot better than we had 30 or 40 years ago.

But right now there is significant unemployment. Not any higher than it was in 1982 or thereabouts, but it’s a lot and it’s not going to go away fast, although it is going to go away.

And we should take — in my view, society owes some minimum living standard to people who are looking for work, trying to get work, and frankly, at a time like this, they’re not going to be able to find it.

But I don’t think that Berkshire Hathaway should be the social safety net.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, I would say that if Berkshire started out to create a bunch of make-work jobs in order to increase human hope, the net effect would, over time, would be the reduce human hope. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: I think that’s true, but I’d rather have Charlie saying it than me. (Laughter)

**6. Why GEICO isn’t looking at China or India**

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: “Our car insurance business” —

Oh, this comes from a New York man who asked that I use his initials, A.J.

“Our car insurance business has continued to return excellent profits and expand its business within the United States. Why hasn’t Berkshire made any progress in the car insurance business in China, or India, or even Europe?

“As BYD has shown, these markets are exploding in automobile sales, so aren’t they ripe for the picking?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. There’s no — we’ve known for a long time there’s no shortage of drivers around the world. That — there may be a lot of business in the United States, but there’s a whole lot of business elsewhere.

In terms of India and China specifically, we can only own a limited amount, I believe 24.9 percent, of a company in either of those countries. And we’re not eager to work hard on something where we own 24.9 when we could work hard on something where we can own 100 percent.

Obviously, we talk all the time, we’ve thought for decades about ways we can possibly expand GEICO, because it’s a wonderful, wonderful company.

And we have gone from a market share of 2-and-a-faction percent when we bought control to 8 1/2 or so now.

But there’s plenty to do here. And we do not have the same kind of advantages — or we don’t think we could build those in any reasonable period of time — as we look at other markets.

I mean, obviously we look at Canada. You know, I mean — Tony and I talk about this kind of thing frequently.

I agree with his decision that now, and probably for a long time to come, there is so much opportunity in the United States. And the other areas, for one reason or another, as we’re looking at them, do not give us the same kind of competitive advantage we have here, that we pass on them.

But we love the idea of taking a business that’s working in one area and figuring out a way to have it work in other areas. Whether it’s geographical adjacencies or product extensions, or all kinds of things.

We’re well aware of possibilities out there. In the case of GEICO, we have not decided to go to other countries, but it isn’t because we didn’t know there were cars there. (Laughter)

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I’ve got nothing to add. (Laughter)

**7. China’s economic growth is “fun” to watch**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Number 3.

CHINESE STUDENT: Good afternoon. My name is Shin Tse Chen (PH). I am a Chinese student from Kansas State University.

My question is, Mr. Buffett, what is the most important thing that you have learned from China? Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Most important thing I’ve learned from China?

CHARLIE MUNGER: China, yeah.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. What’s the most important thing you’ve learned from China, Charlie? (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: It has some very unusual people in BYD. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: I’ve learned —

CHARLIE MUNGER: No other lesson is as important as that one. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: I’ve learned they like Sprite better than Coke. Sprite outsells Coke in China by two-to-one. But they’re both growing dramatically.

I think China is an amazing economy. I mean, there is no question in my mind that, you know, the growth on a per-capita basis is going to be dramatic going forward. They’re just starting to exercise their potential.

When you think about it, in 1790, there were four million people in the United States, just under four million. There were 290 million in China in 1790. Just as smart, you know, just as hard working, resources of the land, the minerals, everything, its climate, very, very similar.

And for 170 years or so, relatively little progress was made in the standard of living for those people, like you say, who had all the native abilities that America had.

But, you know, in recent decades, the potential of the Chinese is being unleashed and it’s huge. And I think it’s very, very interesting to watch.

Charlie and I, and a group of some of the directors, are going over there at the end of September.

You know — and I was over there a couple of years ago. It’s a sight to behold.

But, in terms of specific lessons, they haven’t taught me how to eat Chinese food, I will say that. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: I think I always knew that the Chinese people had an enormous potential for huge and rapid progress, because I could see that in all the Chinese-Americans that I dealt with.

And indeed, people came in here as Chinese “coolies” — in effect, slaves — and they rose so rapidly that it was a marvel.

So I always knew that China had a potential to be a huge credit to human civilization. But I think I underrated how fast it could happen.

China is setting a new record for advancement of civilization at a very rapid rate. It’s fun to watch.

**8. Why Buffett addresses the annual report to his two sisters**

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from a shareholder in Aiken, South Carolina who asks not to be identified, but he asks that Mr. Buffett or Mr. Munger discuss changes that have been made in the Berkshire annual report in the last several years, and the reasons for making some of these changes.

Two of the changes that he’s noticed are, number one , look-through earnings no longer seem to be discussed, and number two, the unaudited combined financial statements of the business groups no longer seem to be included, although at least some of the business groups material seem to be covered in other places in the report.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, the second point I’m confused about, because we have broken them down into four groups and tried to give the relevant financial information for what we thought was a logical grouping, and will continue to do that. So I’m not sure I totally get that.

We really do have four fairly logical breakdowns. Now, you can break it down 70 ways and all that, but there’s a point at which adding 100 pages to an annual report obfuscates information rather than illuminates.

And that’s what — we’re trying to, in a reasonable number of words — Carol might say too many — but in a reasonable number of words, convey as much as we can about the information we’d want to have if we were in your place and you were writing to us.

And we think these four classifications — regulated industry is terribly capital intensive. You know, insurance: capital, really not a factor, but the amount of capital it gives us being a factor, and so on.

And so I don’t think we really changed on that. Now, when you get into look-through earnings or sometimes when we talk about the earnings per share and the investments per share, some of that I don’t repeat every year because we try to get — run at, maybe, 12,000 words or something like that in the annual report.

I really think if you extend it too much — I’ll say this, nobody’s told me it was too short, yet — (laughs) — including my editor, who is here today.

And every other year I may do that breakdown between operating earnings and the — but that takes 1,000 words or so to explain it to people.

The whole report is guided, as it has been ever since I really started taking it seriously in the mid ’70s, is guided by the idea that I’m — actually, I’m writing it to my two sisters who are here. And I have my audience in my mind — is two very intelligent, interested people but who are not around the place, been gone for a year, and they’re very capable of understanding anything but they’re not necessarily familiar with all the lingo.

If I get too esoteric on it, so I should explain that. And I really want them to understand how I’m thinking about the business, and by implication, how I think they should think about it, and to answer the questions that I think would be in their mind.

And they’ve got most of their net worth in it, so they’re going to read to the end. And I really haven’t changed that framework in my mind for how I’ve written it.

I start mentally off writing, “Dear Doris and Bertie,” and then I just cross them off and put, “To the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway.” But that’s the way it’s done.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, but the details can change as the facts change. The undistributed earnings of corporations in which we hold shares, but do not control, used to be way more important than they are now. It’s perfectly natural that the emphasis would shift.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, the undistributed earnings now, without me looking at it very carefully, you know, are probably — they’re not more than, probably, 15 percent of our reported earnings or something like that.

They used to be a much higher percentage. And they’re still important. But I don’t think they’re — I think the people that understand that Coca-Cola and American Express aren’t paying out all their earnings, and it’s not a big enough number that I would want to spend a lot of the report explaining it.

**9. Munger endorses Roth IRAs**

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 4.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Joe Hudson (PH), a shareholder from Culver, Indiana.

I doubt either of you have any money in Roth IRAs, but what are your thought on the opportunity this year for anyone to convert IRAs to Roth IRAs, thus having all future growth on Berkshire or other investments 100 percent tax free?

Is the government making a big mistake here, and should people be concerned about the deal changing down the road?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I’ll take this one, because I have an IRA that I am going to convert to a Roth IRA. So there’s your answer. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I still don’t understand it, but —

CHARLIE MUNGER: You don’t have to. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. He’s always telling me that. (Laughter)

I assume - if Charlie said it, it must be true.

**10. Newspapers are losing ground in battle with internet**

WARREN BUFFETT: Let’s go to Andrew. (Laughter)

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question I’m actually very self-interested in. It comes from Anton Ossip (at) Alexander Forbes from Johannesburg, and (he writes), “Last year you said you were down on the newspaper industry.

“Given your life-long interest in newspaper companies and your stake in the Washington Post Company and others, has your view changed in the past year with the introduction of the iPad and other e-reading technologies?

“Do you think we will see a contraction in the value of — in the value retained by — media houses versus what will be passed on to distributors of the media?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you could probably answer it better than I can.

My relatively uninformed opinion — because I’m not that up on the technology — but I just have a feeling that when the money — has basically — the money to run good newspapers has come from advertising, you know, three-quarters of the money or thereabouts — the papers become less useful to advertisers.

I mean, they were the only game in town for a long, long time. They are not the only game in town. And what a difference that makes if you’re selling something.

So, when the Philadelphia Inquirer, I — Stan Lipsey is here — I called Stan up and I said, “Stan, this is probably like an old fire horse or something, but let’s think about it anyway a little bit.”

And it was sold yesterday at a bankruptcy sale, although I think that’s pending confirmation.

But, you know, it is very tempting, if you’ve still got fairly substantial circulation - The Philadelphia Inquirer and they’ve got the Daily News there, too.

But the math is really tough. I mean, the distribution costs, the printing costs, everything, and maybe all this changes that in some way that you would understand better than I would.

But since I don’t understand it, I have to stay with — and there are plenty of things I don’t understand — and I cannot make an affirmative decision on newspaper ownership.

I just got the — the ABC puts out Fast Facts, this big yellow publication — I just got it a couple days ago and I can’t resist looking through there. And I flip the pages and look at circulation of all kinds of papers.

Actually, in Buffalo, we were down less than a great many papers, even though, you know, our population demographics are very tough. We were down less than Rochester, I might mention, which is owned by Gannett.

But you look at San Francisco Chronicle, you know, down 20-odd percent. Dallas —

These are communities that are thriving, and it blows your mind how fast people are dropping it.

It’s not just older — it’s not just that younger people aren’t picking it up. I mean, the world has really changed, in terms of the essential nature of newspapers.

There’s nothing that looked — back when Charlie and I would talk about them in 1970 or ’65, there was probably nothing that looked more bulletproof than a daily newspaper where the competition had melted away.

But it’s a form of distributing information and entertainment that has lost its immediacy in many cases.

It’s certainly — it is not the essential place to get — think about how stock market quotations were, you know, 30 or 35 years ago. You looked in the paper to see what stocks had done. You looked in the paper to see how sports games had turned out.

So its primacy has withered away, and the advertisers weren’t there because they love the publisher of the newspaper. They were there because it was a microphone to talk to everybody in town, and they had to talk to everybody in town.

And so you get this chicken and egg thing that the newspaper becomes less valuable as the advertisers float away, and the advertisers float away as the subscribers diminish. And I don’t see a good answer to it, but Charlie, what do you have to say?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, the independent newspapers, due to the accidents of history, as they became dominant in their individual towns, for decades had impregnable economic strength.

And by and large they behaved better because they were so strong. And they were called the ”Fourth Estate.” They were really a branch of the government, they helped keep government honest.

And if you take this state in which we’re located, The World-Herald has been a very constructive force, net, over a long period of time. As those dominant franchises have weakened and weakened, it’s not good for the country.

I think we’re losing something that we have no substitute for. And I think it’s very sad and I don’t have the faintest idea what to do about it.

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie and I love newspapers.

I think The World-Herald hit a 300,000 circulation peak on Sunday at one time. I don’t think they averaged that for the six-month period, but I seem to remember that, I could be wrong.

And the figures — 100,000 off that or something of the sort, and the state has gained population, the city’s gained population.

I think it’s as vital to me as ever, but it clearly — it has changed for the populous as a whole.

And, you know, when I look at the Philadelphia Inquirer and I forget what it was, 350,000 or something like that of circulation, and, you know, I’m not worried about Philadelphia going away.

But when I look at the figures being down — I don’t know, I forget what it was now — 30 or 40,000, you know, in a year, it doesn’t work very well as that goes along, because the advertiser just does not need you the same way as they needed you 10 or 15 years ago. So your ability to price evaporates in them.

It used to be — Charlie and I met Lord Thompson in 1970 or so, and he owns the paper — he owned the paper — in Council Bluffs, right across the river. And he was a jovial fellow, he was very happy to see us.

And we said to him, “Lord Thomson,” we said, “We noticed you own the paper in Council Bluffs. Have you ever been there?” He said, “I wouldn’t dream of it.” (Laughter)

And then I said, “Well, Lord Thomson,” I said, “You seem to increase the price of your paper every year and your poor advertisers” — I mean the advertising price. And I said, “What can they do about it?” He says, “Nothing.”

And then I said to him, “Well, in that case, how do you decide how much to increase prices, since it’s totally at your discretion?”

And he said — I think Charlie will remember these words — he says, “I tell my U.S. managers to price to make 40 percent pre-tax. Above that, I feel I may be gouging.” (Laughter)

Those days are gone. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes, and the politicians are not behaving better as the newspapers are weakening. We’re going to miss the newspaper power.

WARREN BUFFETT: I agree with that. (Applause)

**11. There will “always be opportunities to overperform”**

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 5.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Robert McArthur (PH) from Boston, Massachusetts.

I’m starting a career in investing, and many, if not most, investors my age think they’re value investors.

Also, there’s a record number of people here to see you this year, and the same value investors who were laughed at three years ago are now celebrated by the financial press.

Will there be fewer metaphorical $100 bills left on the street going forward, and if so, should I look for a career in managing a business instead of managing money?

WARREN BUFFETT: There will probably be fewer, but I would say there will always be — except in the most bubbly of markets, perhaps — but there will always be opportunities if you’re not working with large amounts of money.

The money manager — there’s a basic conflict. There’s conflicts in most businesses. Everybody’s pointing out the conflicts now in the investment banking business.

But the investment management business has a conflict that’s equally as significant in the fact that asset gathering can become a way more important part of your income than asset managing.

But if you manage moderate sums of money, I think there will always be opportunities to overperform. That doesn’t mean lots of people are going to do it, but they will be out there.

And, you know, it might have been easier many years ago when there were fewer people looking and not as much information was available on the internet and all that.

But people still make the same mistakes and they still get — well, I’ll give you an illustration.

Charlie has a company called the Daily Journal Company. And the Daily Journal Company has a bunch of cash. And it sat there with cash, and it sat there with cash, and I own 100 shares — which is all he’ll let me own — and I got their annual report here a while back.

And in their fiscal year of 2009, they never bought stocks before that I’d seen, and all of a sudden they’d bought $15 million worth of stocks and they were worth 45 million.

So by sitting around for a while, but waiting until things got really ridiculous in certain cases, he put $15 million out that became 45 million within, probably, a six month period or so.

So opportunities come around. You have to be prepared to grab them when they come. And you can’t do it with the kind of money — I mean, you can’t get the extraordinary things with the kind of money that we’re running.

With moderate amounts of money, I think there will always be opportunities. Charlie’s going to tell you something more pessimistic now, probably. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. One piece of advice that Warren frequently gives — and it’s particularly useful to those going into money management — take the high road. It’s far less crowded. (Laughter and applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: Alan Simpson used to say, he said, “Those who take the high road in Washington are seldom bothered by heavy traffic.” (Laughter)

But getting to the last part of your question, there’s going to be opportunities for talent, whether it’s in money management, operating management, whatever. It’s going to work.

Money management, you know, is easier to scale up and easier to get into and all of that. So it was certainly my natural inclination, in any event.

I would not have wanted to work my way up to plant superintendent and all of that — (laughs) — until I got a job at the top, you know, about the time they were going to give me a gold watch.

But there’s opportunities in both places.

**12. Municipal bond insurers must worry about contagion**

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: This question is about municipal bonds. Municipal bond defaults, on the scale you described in the 2008 letter, have so far not materialized.

To what extent will we see municipalities default outright in the next five to 10 years? Will the bond insurance companies be able to swallow the losses? Will there be federal bailouts of states?

And considering all of these risks, should investors be getting paid more than they already are for holding municipal bonds?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, if the bonds are insured by Berkshire, you don’t need to worry at all. (Laughs)

But we’re not insuring a lot of bonds currently, because we don’t think the premiums are appropriate, which gets to the question.

Just the other day, within the last few days — you’ve probably read about it in the papers — Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, defaulted on a relatively small amount of bonds.

And the bond insurer, named Assured Guarantee, starts paying the interest.

And Harrisburg may get things worked out in a week, you know, and they may not. There’s certainly some incentive to do that. And if they do get it worked out, the bond insurer’s not too much on the hook.

But what you worry about is correlation in this field, that if one entity defaults — and particularly if nothing terrible happens, that the police are on the street the next day, and the fire trucks still go to fires and all that — and people start thinking, “Why should I have a great fiscal reputation when I can have lower taxes and still have all the services I need?”

It’s very hard to tell how that will play out. I personally think it would be very hard, in the end, for the federal government to turn away a state that was having extreme financial difficulties when they’d, in effect, gone into General Motors and various other entities and saved them.

I don’t know exactly how you would tell the governor of state X that you were going to stiff-arm him, and when you’d participated in so many other bailouts of corporations.

But who knows what would happen, and who knows how contagious it would be? The big thing you worry about if you’re a bond insurer is contagion.

Obviously the bond insurers — except for Berkshire — the bond insurers, in my view, have got extraordinary liabilities in relation to their capital.

And virtually every one of them either failed or effectively failed — had to spin off a bad bank versus a good bank type of thing, or something like that — with merely the troubles they encountered when they got into structured securities.

And I think they’ve had a very optimistic attitude toward what could happen in the field. But I don’t know the answer on what default rates are going to be over the next few years.

I knew that I felt I was getting paid fairly for taking that risk on a year-and-a-half ago, and I don’t feel that we’re getting offered a premium that’s fair now, so we’re going to let somebody else do it.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, with the municipal bonds, I would try and invest in places that were both prosperous and disciplined.

You want to invest in the prosperous, because Ben Franklin was right when he said, “It’s hard for an empty sack to stand upright.”

And you want to invest in the disciplined places because integrity still matters. It’s not very difficult, it’s not very complicated.

WARREN BUFFETT: But you could argue that in a country, if the undisciplined are not being punished for being undisciplined, that the taxpayers in disciplined areas would say, “Wait a second. You know, why should we keep up a record of financial prudence and all that and pay our bills when other guys aren’t paying their bills?”

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, there’s no question about the fact that bad behavior is contagious. That’s the way human nature works. But I’d still rather be with the disciplined, —

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

CHARLIE MUNGER: — prosperous people.

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 6.

CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s why I like the Berkshire meeting. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: That, and free fudge. (Applause)

**13. Short-term stock moves aren’t predictable and don’t matter**

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. I’m (inaudible) from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. First of all I want to thank you for sharing your wisdom with us so generously.

Back in October of 2008, you highly recommended buying U.S. stocks and that was a brilliant idea, it worked very well.

And I just want to get your opinion how you think about the market going forward.

Are you still that optimistic, and what’s a reasonable rate of return to expect from equities in the next decade or so?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I write articles very infrequently, or get interviewed very infrequently, on the subject of the general level of the market itself. Probably only four or five times in 40 years have I really declared myself about — what I thought — about the general level of the stock market.

And it turned out I was pretty premature, actually, in October of 2008, as was pointed out to me by a number of people.

But I felt — and what I said in that article really was that it would be way better to own stocks over the long term than to follow a policy of buying either long-term bonds or holding cash. And I knew I could make that statement and I would be eventually — I thought odds were very high — I’d be proven right on that.

But I don’t like — I don’t know what the stock market’s going to do next week, or next month, or next year. I don’t have any idea.

People always think I do. I know I don’t have any idea, I don’t think about it, it doesn’t make any difference because Charlie and I — I can’t recall a discussion we’ve ever had on it, basically.

But I do think over the next 10 years or 20 years, I’d much rather own equities — including U.S. equities — I’d much rather own them than cash, or I’d much rather own them than a 10 or 20-year bond. But that’s partly because I’m very unenthusiastic about the alternatives.

I think equities are likely to give you some positive — modest positive — real return over time. But beyond that I really don’t know anything.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s a cheerful thought that equities are the best of a bad lot of available opportunities. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: You disagree with it?

CHARLIE MUNGER: No, I think you’re right. (Laughter)

I think people should get accustomed, on average, to doing less well in their investment portfolios, in real terms.

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie and I don’t —

CHARLIE MUNGER: I think we’re in for a long period of where the ordinary result is not going to be very exciting.

WARREN BUFFETT: But we like owning businesses. And we’re in a position where we can own entire businesses, but we also like partial ownership of businesses.

And we want to own businesses where we really think they have some competitive advantage over time, and where we feel good about the management, and where we think the price is reasonably attractive.

I think you can find things like that now, but they aren’t dramatically attractive at all. They do beat, in my view, they do beat holding cash or five, 10, or 20-year bonds.

**14. Why we don’t use bond rating agencies**

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from John Bailer (PH), who’s asking about the rating agencies. He points out that you started selling your stake in Moody’s this year.

“Has the investment case for Moody’s changed due to potential regulation, and if so, why not sell the position to zero?”

WARREN BUFFETT: We won’t discuss what we will or won’t do with any position, but I would say this. The ratings agencies have had, and still have, under current conditions, an incredibly wonderful business.

I mean, it takes no capital at all, you know, the pricing power is significant. And certain parts of the world feel they need rating agencies.

There are also — a certain part of the world is very mad at rating agencies. And many feel that the rating agencies let them down when the rating agencies, essentially, succumbed to the same mania, in effect, you can say, that prevailed throughout the investment world, and, really, the political world, and the media world, et cetera.

They made the same mistake that, again, politicians made, I made, you know, you made, mortgage brokers made, whomever.

They couldn’t see a world where residential housing, countrywide, would collapse.

And I don’t think that was done because they were — the incentive part of it, there may have been some small aspect that that played. I just think that, you know, it’s very hard to think contrary to the crowd.

And on the other hand, there is a, obviously, a backlash against rating agencies. There may be legal remedies. You can get views on that either way.

If they are not forced to change their — the whole structure around them does not change in some dramatic way — it’s a pretty darn good business in that you can’t shop pricing in the rating agency business.

We have never paid any attention to ratings for bonds, I mean, you know, at Berkshire. We don’t think we should farm out, outsource, investment judgment.

If we can’t do it ourselves, we just don’t do it. And we’re not going to rely on somebody else’s opinion, whether it’s a rating agency or an investment advisory organization, or a management consultant firm, or anybody else.

So, it’s not a business that we rely on, but we do recognize that if the, sort of, the social model doesn’t change, it still remains a phenomenal business.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I would argue that the rating agencies, in their present forum, and structured with their present incentives, have been a wonderfully constructive influence in our country for a great many decades.

And what happened, of course, is that the cognition faltered. They drifted with the stupidity of their times in a way that was regrettable.

Part of it came out of asininity in American business education. They overbelieved in these ridiculous models and so on and so on. And I have yet to hear a single apology from business academia for its huge contribution to our present difficulties. (Applause)

**15. World will find a solution when oil “windfall” gives out**

WARREN BUFFETT: Area 7.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mike McCoy (PH) from San Francisco.

Chairman Buffett, you frequently speak favorably about the prosperity of future generations, that our children and our children’s children will live better than us.

How much of our current prosperity do you attribute to us being able to get oil out of the ground at a fraction of the cost of its value to us in the economy?

And how will we be able to live better in the future when we can no longer get more and more of this free lunch and we become dependent on more dilute sources like solar and wind?

Couldn’t this turn out like trying to satisfy a drug addict with a Coca-Cola?

WARREN BUFFETT: The oil business — obviously, the discovery of oil — what was it, about 1850- something? Colonel Drake at Titusville, Pennsylvania, or something?

That changed the world in a very major way, and it was only 150 years ago.

And since then we’ve been sticking straws into the earth at an incredible pace. There’s over 500,000 producing wells in the United States, would you believe that? I mean, 11 barrels, 10 barrels a day average or something of the sort.

We have really exploited what may have taken, I don’t know, whether it was hundreds of thousands of years or millions of years to create.

It’s contributed in a huge way to the prosperity of the world, but the world, in my view, will not be dependent upon that particular — call it “windfall” — for the next hundred years.

And Charlie knows way more about this subject than I do, but there will be other free lunches available. You know, whether it’s solar or — there’s lots of possibilities.

Don’t ever give up on humans’ ability to innovate in ways that create solutions to problems that seem insolvable.

We’ve faced all kinds of predictions. You know, all of the inventions having been invented — there’s some famous statement, I forget who made, on that.

We haven’t really started. I mean, if you could pick a time in history when you would want to be born — leaving out the nuclear, chemical and biological threat, which is something to leave out — but I would pick today. The world has a bright future.

Now, Charlie will give you the other side of that. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: No. I think you’re failing to recognize something really important. In the technology of 150 years ago, they really needed the oil to get ahead.

In our advanced civilization, which has benefited from this last 150 years of technological expertise, we can get ahead without the oil if we have to.

Now, Freeman Dyson is a physicist who is not an economist but a genius, and he’s been very good at pointing out that it isn’t that horrible to contemplate a world which goes off oil, provided that world is as rich and knowledgeable as ours is now.

So the fact that they couldn’t have got to where we are now without the oil starting 150 years ago, does not mean we can’t do without the oil if we have to.

We need the oil and the gas, and the coal, eventually, for chemical feed stocks more than we need it for keeping warm and propelling our vehicles.

WARREN BUFFETT: And the adjustment, fortunately, will be fairly gradual. I mean, it isn’t like 85 million barrels in the day goes to 50 million or something in five or 10 years. So it’s a workable period of adjustment, in my view.

CHARLIE MUNGER: If it doesn’t bother Freeman Dyson, who knows more about it, I don’t think it should bother you too much. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: He’s always pulling that on me. (Laughter)

**16. Buffett doesn’t like Kraft’s purchase of Cadbury**

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: I received a number of questions regarding Kraft, and this one comes from a shareholder who says they prefer to remain anonymous.

The question is, “Given your stake in Kraft and your public criticism earlier this year about the Kraft-Cadbury deal, how would you grade the Kraft board of director’s capital allocation and the management compensation abilities?

“What did you think of Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld’s $26.3 million compensation package for services, including her leadership in completing the Cadbury acquisition and selling Kraft’s North American frozen pizza business?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I didn’t like either the Cadbury decision or the pizza decision. But we’ve made our share of dumb deals at Berkshire, you know.

So I’ve gotten more tolerant of other people, and incidentally the fact I think it’s a dumb deal doesn’t for certain make it a dumb deal, but I think the odds are it was a dumb deal.

In fact, I think the odds are that both deals were dumb. The pizza deal was particularly dumb, but — in my view.

But just think of all the dumb things we’ve done, right? Starting with that department store in Baltimore.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Oh yeah, right. A few Irish banks, you know.

WARREN BUFFETT: Right, (inaudible).

CHARLIE MUNGER: We never seem to go —

WARREN BUFFETT: I wish you hadn’t brought this up.

CHARLIE MUNGER: — we never get over it. (Laughs)

WARREN BUFFETT: We expect to do some dumb things, it’s just we get mad when other people do dumb things with our money. (Laughs)

You know, the pizza business — somewhere I probably have some figures on that — but when they sold the pizza business for $3.7 billion they announced it as selling it for $3.7 billion.

They didn’t sell it for $3.7 billion, that’s what the other guy paid. What they got was about $2.5 billion. And that was a terribly tax-inefficient deal when they’d already shown their ability to understand that you could do a tax-efficient deal when they sold the Post cereals business earlier.

And when they referenced — well, they didn’t reference at all what pizza was earning beforehand, but I think that Nestle said it was earning something like 280 million pre-tax, but that was referring to the previous year.

When they talked about the Cadbury earnings they were buying, they were talking about next year. And when they talked about the pizza earnings they were selling, they talked about last year.

Pizza in 2009, believe it or not, earned three hundred and, I think, 40 million pre-tax.

So they got 2 1/2 billion for 340 million of pizza earnings that were growing as fast or faster than the Cadbury earnings and where the sales were going as fast or faster. It really didn’t make sense in my view.

Now, you know, Irene is a perfectly capable manager and she may know a lot of things about that business I don’t know. Like I say, we’ve made plenty of mistakes ourselves.

But if it’d been me, I would have voted to keep pizza and not buy Cadbury. And I expressed myself, and I don’t do that too often, but we owned a lot of Kraft.

And Kraft, still, is selling for considerably less than the value of its constituent parts, particularly if you value them the way they valued Cadbury. (Laughter)

But if they don’t sell them all like they sold pizza, you know, the present price is below the value of Kool-Aid and A.1. Sauce and — and Jell-O and Oscar Meyer wieners and a few things.

Those are very good businesses. I just hated to see them give up a significant portion of those businesses to buy Cadbury at what I felt was a very fancy price.

Charlie?

And in terms of her compensation, you know, we’ve got a compensation system at Berkshire that I regard as quite rational. And there’s a lot of companies in the United States that have different compensation systems. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, I think generally, at the top of American businesses, people think they know too much about strategy. And they tend to hate the tough competitive conditions in the business they’re in, and to yearn for some business where it’s less difficult.

You remember when Xerox bought Crum & Forster, an American insurance company, one of the dumbest acquisitions in all time?

The reason Xerox did that is they didn’t have any tough Japanese competing in the insurance business. They were really tired of facing the tough competition they had in the business they were in.

I think it’s quite typical to dream, if you’re in business, that something that’s a little different, no matter how much you pay for it, will make your troubles less.

WARREN BUFFETT: And you will have an absolute army of lawyers, investment advisors, public relations people, all of whom will have a strong economic interest in having you push ahead on deal, after deal, after deal, regardless of how the shareholders come out. It’s just — it’s the way it works. OK.

CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s why Berkshire is a better deal. (Laughter)

We are very stupid in many ways, but we have avoided a slight subset of stupidities. (Laughter)

And they’re important.

**17. Biggest threat to integrity: “everyone else is doing it”**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK Number 8.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Dear Mr. Buffett, dear Mr. Munger. My name is Richard Rentrop. I’m a shareholder from Germany.

Mr. Munger, you just mentioned again the importance of integrity. My question is about changes in integrity of management.

One of your three key questions is, does management love what they do or does management love the money? So how do you see the crisis having changed integrity of management?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I think what led to the crisis involved, to some extent, a lack of integrity in many a management. Fortunately, some of them are now gone. So, integrity’s very important.

It’s the safest way to make money, also. There’s an occasional perfect knave who succeeds pretty well with money, but that kind of success reminds me of what Pope Urban said about Cardinal Richelieu.

He said, “If there is a God, Cardinal Richelieu has much to answer for. But if there is no God, he’s done rather well.” (Laughter)

And too many people want to be like Pope Urban’s view of Cardinal Richelieu.

And — the integrity is important, it’s terribly important. And of course everybody mouths the integrity, even when it’s lacking.

So it’s difficult to be sure that professing integrity is the same as having it.

WARREN BUFFETT: The “everyone else is doing it” is the toughest thing. I think —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

WARREN BUFFETT: You had this classic example. In about 1993, roughly, you know, the Accounting Standards Board came out and says what was obvious to everybody all along, was that stock options were actually expense, and that expenses, for some reason or another, belonged on the income statement.

And America — corporate America — fought back like you cannot believe. I mean, it was like World War III had broken out, in terms of armies of CEOs marching on Washington.

So the Accounting Standard Board backed off. Congress — the Senate — voted 88 to 9 to tell them that, you know, what the hell did the Accounting Standards Board know about accounting, and that the Senate would tell them what accounting was all about.

When the Accounting Standards Board backed off, they said, “We’ll now say that you can do it one of two ways. Number one is preferred,” which was to expense. Number two was acceptable, but not preferred.

Of the Standard & Poor’s 500 companies, 498 chose number two, the non-preferred way. Two took the preferred method.

And I talked to a number of people in that 498 that I would trust to be a trustee of my will, you know, I’d love to have them as a next door neighbor, they could marry my daughter, but in the end they said, “I can’t do it if the other guy isn’t doing it.”

It was a variation on the, “I’m doing it because the other guy is doing it.”

They basically said, “I’ll be penalizing my shareholders if I report less in the way of earnings than I can report. And all the other guys are doing it that way, and I understand your point.”

And the situational ethics problem is huge. I gave you earlier that illustration of how rare it is to find, if you carry it out to tenths of a cent, a four in reported earnings, quarterly.

That’s not accidental and it’s — but if you talk to the people that play games to get that four up to five, they would say, “Everybody else is doing it, your own statistics proved that.”

And that is, you know, it is a tough problem to deal with.

We try to create as few situations in Berkshire as we can that would induce such behavior. I don’t have the managers submit budgets to me, there is no Berkshire budget, you know. They can use them in their own operations. Some do and some don’t. Many do, a great many do.

But if they submit them to me, you know, and the temptation becomes, if they’re not quite making it and they think I’m looking at them all the time, the temptation becomes to fudge in some way.

And very few would do it, but the more that thought the other ones were doing it, the more that would do it. It’s just human behavior. And you want to try and create a structure that minimizes the weaknesses in human behavior.

And I think Berkshire’s about as good a place at that as any, although I’m sure we’re not perfect at it.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, what’s really interesting on this issue is that so much of the bad behavior does not come from malevolence or overweening greed or anything like that.

It comes from subconscious poor cognition that justifies a lot of behavior that’s really not justifiable if it’s better understood. And that happens to practically everybody.

And the cure is very difficult. The best cure is to have a system where the people who are making the decisions bear the consequences.

And that’s why the system that Wall Street created where nobody really owned the mortgages, they just passed them rapidly to somebody else at a profit. And so nobody felt any responsibility that the mortgages be any good.

Systems like that, at a basic level, are irresponsible systems, and it’s deeply immoral to create irresponsible systems like that.

But the people who create them don’t realize they’re being immoral, they think those systems are wonderful.

Who do you see apologizing for the behavior you now find so regrettable in our recent mess?

There are very few apologies, you’ll note. People think they did fine.

**18. Can’t make money if you’re scared when everyone else is scared**

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol? (Applause)

CAROL LOOMIS: This question is from James A. Star.

“I have read an enormous amount about past market declines and the opportunities they presented to investors.

“The last two years have seemed to me, a 43-year-old investor, a real opportunity. Yet in the thick of the action, I was too scared, because I felt the market decline, while severe, was not necessarily sufficient to match the risks of global financial meltdown.

“So my question is, given that we are possibly not totally out of the woods, how did the two of you assess this latest buying opportunity against the previous opportunities of your life?”

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s not the greatest one. We’ve seen a few that scream at us, and we’ve seen a few periods of overvaluation that scream at us. And 90 percent of the time we’re somewhere in between and we don’t know exactly where we are in between.

The business of being scared, you know, I don’t know what you do about that.

If you’re of that — if you have a temperament that when others are fearful you’re going to get scared yourself, you know, you are not going to make a lot of money in securities over time, in all probability.

You know, people really — if they didn’t look at quotations — but, of course, the whole world is urging them to look at quotations, and more than that, do something based on small changes in quotations.

But think how much more rational — we’ve talked about it before — but think how much more rational investing in a farm is than the way many people buy stocks.

If you buy a farm, do you get a quote next week, do you get a quote next month? If you buy an apartment house, do you get a quote next week or month?

No, you look at the apartment house or the farm and you say, “I expect it to produce so many bushels of soy beans and corn, and if it does that, it meets my expectations.”

If they buy a stock and they think if it goes up it’s wonderful, and if it goes down it’s bad.

We think just the opposite. When it goes down we love it, because we’ll buy more. And if it goes up, it kills us to buy more.

And I — you know — all kinds — you know, Ben Graham wrote about it. It’s been explained. But if you can’t get yourself in that mental attitude, you’re going to be scared whenever everybody else is scared.

And to expect somebody else to tell you when to buy and therefore get your courage back up or something, you know, I could get this fellow’s courage up substantially by saying this is a wonderful time to buy, and then a week from now he’d run into somebody else that tells him the world is coming to an end and he’d sell.

I mean, he’s a broker’s friend, but he’s not going to make a lot of money.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, I think I developed more courage after I learned I could handle hardship. So maybe you should get your feet wet with a little more failure. (Laughter and applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: I’ve certainly followed that advice. (Laughter)

No, some people really do not have the — apparently, they don’t have the temperament, or emotional stability, or whatever it may be, to invest in securities.

They’d be much better off if there were no quotations at all. And Keynes talked about that some in the past, too.

To take something that should be an asset, a quotation every day, you know, terrific liquidity, nobody says, “How liquid is my farm?” or something of the sort. So they’re not expecting the prices to tell them something about how they’re doing.

The market is saying this or that. Whenever anybody says, “The market is saying this or that,” you know, it’s sort of unbelievable.

But there’s a lot of interest in investing, and people are going to yak about it all the time.

And in the end, what counts is buying a good business at a decent price, and then forgetting about it for a long, long, long time. And some people can do it and some people can’t.

**19. Munger is “enormously optimistic” about solar power**

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 9.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, my name is Joe McCabe (PH). I’m from Littleton, Colorado. I want to thank you for the opportunity to ask a question and for your annual discussions in your report, just wonderful reading.

Charlie Munger, you are on a YouTube video that discusses BYD and solar energy, and I really appreciate that interview and it being available to everyone. I want to talk about that in relationship to your other companies.

So the BYD was mentioned as electric car and battery, but I understand their second goal is solar energy.

And you also own roofing companies and buildings companies, (inaudible) and Clayton, as well as utilities, Mid-America, PacifiCorp, and Pacific Power.

This seems to be a perfect golden opportunity for solar to be on these buildings in those kinds of utility companies.

You’ve mentioned you don’t interfere with individual companies, but is there a way you can direct, suggest, motivate a synergy between all these companies to bring solar solutions? Thank you.

CHARLIE MUNGER: As the solar solutions are coming, because they’re so obviously needed.

And regarding solar panels on roofs, I never pass an opportunity to decline to put them in, because I think they’re going to get a lot cheaper and I’d rather wait.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, at 86 you can afford to, Charlie. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes, I have to think about the long term. (Laughter)

And I’m going to miss you terribly. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Touché.

CHARLIE MUNGER: It reminded me of the wife, and the husband said, “Will you still love me if I lost all of my money?” And she says, “Yes, I would always love you, but I would miss you terribly.” (Laughter)

Well, the solar is coming because we have no other practical alternative.

And it should be regarded as a very good thing, because what in hell would modern civilization do if we had no alternative to fossil fuels? That would be a really serious problem.

And so of course, the cities that are chocking to death on their own poisonous air are going to go to electric cars and we’re going to get a lot more renewable energy from the sun.

I’m also quite negative about growing corn in America using fossil water and fossil fuels in order to burn up in automobiles. (Applause)

That is a stunningly stupid idea, and another example of how our politicians have failed us.

But I am enormously optimistic about what is going to happen. Our politicians will eventually create a big electric grid that’s way better than what we have now. We’ll eventually have the energy we need, and we will be way better for it.

And it’s wonderful that these technical problems are proving solvable.

It is not all that important over the long term, if solar power costs twice as much as what we’re used to. That’s a blip in the economic future of our country, it’s just a blip.

And I think it’s probably a good thing that we have all these big capital needs coming that will create a better system in the end and solve our problems in the end.

So I’m quite optimistic. But in terms of immediate business decisions, I think frequently the right answer is counterintuitive, like mine, to say, if you want to put in solar panels, wait. They’re going to get cheaper.

Warren, do you want to criticize that?

WARREN BUFFETT: I have nothing to add. (Laughter)

**20. No “exploding bananas” now in our stock portfolio**

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from Jennifer Mancuso (PH) who is a shareholder here in Omaha. And she’s hoping that you can settle a debate between her husband and her.

WARREN BUFFETT: That a promising assignment. (Laughs)

BECKY QUICK: She says that he believes the Berkshire Hathaway stock will rise significantly in the next one to two years because of all the smart buys Warren made last year in Fortune 500s when stock prices were bottomed out.

She says she knows this type of purchasing has driven much of your financial success, but she doesn’t know how impactful these buys are, given the size of Berkshire Hathaway and that Warren himself indicates that we shouldn’t expect to see large increases in his stock price in the next few years.

So the question is, what percentage of the portfolio is represented by those stock purchases, and what kind of an impact might they have on the fund’s value as the valuation of that stock increases?

WARREN BUFFETT: I would say this, that our portfolio now — I’ve always regarded our portfolio as something that we thought would be worth more money later on.

But the degree of undervaluation in our portfolio now compared to what I would expect it to produce over time is not dramatic, and that undervaluation has been exceeded many times in the past.

So it isn’t like we’re sitting here on some exploding bananas or anything like that. That couldn’t be further from the truth.

We think we’ll do reasonably well over time. We’ve got a lot of good businesses, we try to allocate capital rationally, we don’t waste a lot of money at the top.

But we do not have a whole bunch of things that are likely to increase dramatically in value from here, it just isn’t the case. So I hope she and her husband get along fine. (Laughter)

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I don’t think I can solve any of those domestic troubles, either. In my own day, I simply accepted the other point of view. (Laughter)

**21. “If I can be optimistic when I’m nearly dead, surely the rest of you can handle a little inflation”**

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 10.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello gentlemen, my name is Randy Bellows (PH) and I’m from Rock Hall, Maryland.

I’ve been coming here for many, many years, yet today I sense from each of you a guarded sense, a sense of reserve.

Not quite overt pessimism, but real reserve. You have spoken of impending inflation, government debt, both here and abroad, that’s higher than we’re accustomed to, increased regulation and red tape that may slow innovation and growth.

And just a few minutes ago, Charlie, you spoke of that we have to reduce our expectation of investment returns.

And yet in the same day you say children in India will live better than we do, Chinese will live better than we do, and our own children here in this country will live better than we do today.

Can you give me four or five facts that explain your optimism? And thank you.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, having the main technical problems of civilization — which, of course, are all energy related — having a solution that’s on the horizon and nearly here, that is not a small benefit to humanity.

That is the biggest single problem we have, so of course I’m optimistic about that.

And — I’m optimistic about the culture that generally pervades in Berkshire, because I think it will continue to work.

And of course it gives me some pleasure to see people that have had it tough for a long time — through their own extreme efforts and talents — rising rapidly, as in many parts of China and India.

All of that gives me pleasure, and why shouldn’t it? Of course there are terrible problems, and of course reduced expectations are the rational way. There’s no better way to be happy than getting your expectations down, it’s much easier than —

WARREN BUFFETT: Getting your results up.

CHARLIE MUNGER: — than getting your results up, yeah. (Laughter)

It’s just — we never know anything here except the most elementary common sense. It’s amazing that it’s sufficed for us.

So no, I’m optimistic about life. If I can be optimistic when I’m nearly dead, surely the rest of you can handle a little inflation. (Laughter and applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: I really have nothing to add to that. (Laughter)

**22. Why Buffett prefers TV interviews**

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question comes from Myard Shields (PH), and I want to say in advance that I don’t — I’m not thrilled asking this question and you’ll see why.

The question is, “The American public almost certainly benefits from Mr. Buffett’s increasing media exposure, but is it the best use of your time for Berkshire’s shareholders?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Probably not. (Laughter)

I do a lot of things that aren’t the best use of my time for Berkshire shareholders. I play bridge on the internet 12 hours a week, you know. I’m not sitting there thinking improving my bridge skills is going to do wonders for Berkshire. (Laughs)

No, I — I do — I have seen over the years that the development of broadcast television, as opposed to print, and I would say that if you want to have a record of exactly what you said as opposed to interpreted through not only reporters but editors who bounce back things and say, “Take six paragraphs down to four paragraphs, and why don’t you ask this question?”

I would much rather have a record on Charlie Rose which is permanent. Where people can go back and look at exactly what I said, and my body language, and whether I was kidding.

I’m sure Lloyd Blankfein would have preferred to have a television interview. He would like to take back that remark about, you know, doing God’s work, under any circumstances. But I would bet that that was delivered as a throwaway line in terms of something that was said earlier.

Clearly he did not mean that in a literal sense, but he’s gotten killed in the media because somebody elected to treat it halfway seriously, and then other people, to fit other stories, play it that way.

I like the idea, whether it’s, you know, in terms of CNBC keeping a record of it or Charlie Rose keeping a record of it, of being judged by my own words rather than somebody writing a few paragraphs trying to summarize some views.

And that requires being on television instead of having people, essentially, take a one-hour interview, often just shopping for a single quote that fits their storyline, and having that somehow become representative of what I think.

So the clearer I can be about what I think, whether writing my own annual report or whether being in broadcast, the better I feel about the accuracy of the reporting.

And I figured that out a few years ago. So that’s the direction I go now. And whether it’s the best use of the time, it works fine.

I’ll tell you one story on that. You even have to be a little careful about broadcast.

After we made the Burlington deal, Charlie Rose, who may be here, did an interview with me and we taped it on a Friday morning. And we did the tape, and we had a good time doing it.

And during the tape there was a little section on it showing great railroad scenes, and one had Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, and another one had Marilyn Monroe in “Some Like It Hot,” and then they showed a bunch of the kind of things we had about railroads in our movie this morning.

And when we got all through that, he asked me some question. And just to give a flip answer, but it did tie in with what I’d just seen, I said, “Well, I would have paid more for the Burlington if they’d thrown in Grace Kelly and Marilyn Monroe.” (Laughter)

Well, this taped interview ran an hour and six minutes, so when they ran the tape that night they had to take out six minutes and they took out these railroad scenes that showed Grace Kelly and Marilyn Monroe. (Laughter)

So to anybody that viewed this thing, it looked like I was spending my time there fantasizing about these — while Charlie was talking to me. (Laughter)

So even television isn’t safe. (Laughter)

**23. How Berkshire gets loyal shareholders**

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 11.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, my name is Kip Johann-Berkel from Boston, Massachusetts.

First, thank you both for your writings, annual shareholder meetings, and even the Charlie Rose interviews — (Buffett laughs) — as they have helped me grow both as an investor and as a person.

Berkshire has, in my opinion, the best and most loyal shareholders of any publicly-traded company or mutual fund.

How do you attract and retain a shareholder base, particularly when many of the same behavioral tendencies that produce mispriced securities also produce fleet-footed shareholders? Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, the interesting thing about marketable securities is that, basically, anybody can buy them.

You might elect to join somebody in buying a McDonald’s franchise or a farm, or apartment house, or something, but if you’re running a public company, you know, you can have anybody from, you know, Osama Bin Laden, you know, to the Pope as your shareholder.

I mean, they elected — you don’t elect them, they elect you.

Now, if you want a shareholder body that is going to be in sync with you, it’s important — in my view — it’s important that you let them know exactly what sort of institution you plan to run.

And we’ve got the annual reports, we’ve got television interviews, we’ve got various ways of conveying to people what kind of a place Berkshire is. And to some, that says, “Come in,” and to others it says, “Stay out.”

Phil Fisher wrote a great book on investing back in the very early 1960s and he described the situation this way.

He said, “Look it, you can have a restaurant and it can say ‘French food’ and if you have French food inside, you know, people are going — you’re going to get a satisfied and returning clientele. And you can have another one that says hamburgers. But what you can’t do is have hamburgers on the outside on the marquee and deliver French food inside.”

And so many companies sort of try and promise everything to everybody. Their investor relations department tells them that any shareholder they can get interested, you know, they want.

We want people who think the way we do. And we think, on balance, we won’t disappoint them too much.

But if we get a bunch of people who think that the earnings next quarter are going to be up 10 percent for some reason, and that’s the reason they own the stock, we’re going to have a lot of disappointed people.

And our goal in life is not to spend our time associating with people who are going to be disappointed with us.

It’s our fault if we give out the wrong advertisement. So we try to advertise what we are, and then we try to deliver on that.

And I do think we have the best group of shareholders in the world, you know, among large publicly-traded companies.

And I think it’s because we’ve got people that basically look into buying a business, becoming our partners over the years, and they know we’ll treat them like partners.

And they, in turn, give us a lot of comfort in having a stable shareholder base and a good feeling about just running the whole place.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, what happened here is, to some extent, an accident.

Warren and I started out investing money for our families and friends, and the people who trusted us when we were young and unknown, of course, we developed a strong affection for.

And we morphed into controlling public companies from that base, and so we tend to regard our shareholders, including the new ones, as family.

And that’s not put on, that’s the way we regard you. Other people can’t do that because they morphed into their situation in a different way.

And if you were a CEO and dealt with the average institutional investor, who is interested in having his portfolio management look good the next six months, you’d find it hard to love your shareholders.

They’re sort of a hostile force that are putting unreasonable expectations on you. And so I don’t think Warren and I deserve such wonderful credit for the fact that we have better relations with our shareholders. We came up in a totally different way.

Now, we did have enough sense, when we saw that it was such a good thing and so satisfying, that we stayed with it. But weren’t we — we got into this by accident, didn’t we?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we got in by accident, and we also were blessed with the fact that we did not have an investor relations department that wanted us to go out and pump up.

CHARLIE MUNGER: But that was on purpose.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, yeah. (Laughter)

I have seen them in operation at dozens of companies, I’ve been involved in one way or another. And it is really ridiculous, the idea that you go out and try and cater to the expectations of people that are expecting you to do things you can’t do by operations, but maybe you can do by accounting for a short period of time. It leads to the worst behavior.

And in the end, somebody’s going to own all your shares, you know. There’s no way that shares remain empty, you know, in the shareholder list. So why not get a bunch of people who are going to stick with you who are in sync?

And the way they’re going to be in sync is if you told them rather accurately what you expect, how you expect to do it, and tell them when you make mistakes, all of that.

CHARLIE MUNGER: But we probably shouldn’t be as critical of people who came up a different way dealing with a different shareholder face.

It’s not at all clear that we wouldn’t have ended up somewhat the same way if we’d had the same manner of rising.

WARREN BUFFETT: Sure. Yeah. So we’ll give up being critical for the next five or 10 minutes, and then we’ll go back. (Laughter)

**24. Low interest rates are hurting people scared out of stocks**

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: Very short question. Please comment on the implications of our existing, and perhaps continuing, zero percent interest rate.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it’s very tough for anybody that’s got their investment in short-term money.

You know, if you’re getting a tenth of a percent on some money market fund currently that if you’d started doing that when Columbus landed, and didn’t pay any taxes, you’d have almost doubled your money by now. (Laughter)

It’s really — I mean, people talk about easy money policies, but it isn’t so easy on the people who’ve got the money.

It won’t go on forever, but it may seem like forever to people that are on fixed income. I’m very sympathetic with them.

Basically they got, many of them, became fearful when the world was looking like it was collapsing in late 2008. And the price they pay is really — I know some people like that that are — it’s terrible in terms of returns and their purchasing power will be eaten away. But this will end at some point.

I don’t know how it will end, but I would not like to be chairman of the Fed or secretary of the treasury. Nobody’s ever asked me, but maybe that’s why I say I wouldn’t want to do it.

But the — we will — it won’t work forever to run huge budget deficits and try and have very easy monetary policy. And when — if we do run into trouble, the blame should not go to the Fed, the blame should go to Congress. (Applause)

CHARLIE MUNGER: In some sense, the reality of our situation is almost amusingly depressing.

Stocks are up because the return from loaning your money out at interest in a safe way is so lousy, and of course, one answer is that can’t last.

In which case, stocks won’t be as pronounced a value, relatively speaking. And of course, if it does last, as it has in Japan, we won’t like that either because it will mean we’re mired in some horrible stagnation.

This is a very cheery message. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: The pressure that is exerted by extremely low interest rates — short-term rates — on the value of everything else, it’s hard to overestimate that.

I mean, the reason people have their money out at one-tenth of 1 percent is that they’re afraid of everything else. But as they’re being afraid of everything else abates, as it has over the last couple years, the pressure to push stock prices up, push real estate prices back up, it’s enormous.

And of course, that’s understood by people who have something to do with those matters. But I don’t think you should underestimate the degree to which the last year of stock prices has been a result of the agony that people are being put through that keep their money in short-term money instruments.

Unless they’re terrified of the world, they get pushed into other investments, and I think we’ve seen a lot of that, and we’ll see what happens when money rates do go up, if they do.

**25. Valuing businesses by asking questions**

WARREN BUFFETT: Twelve.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello, my name is Jeff Colvette (PH) and I’m from Olathe, Kansas.

I got started in investing in 1999, right before the big tech bubble, and unfortunately I learned buy and hold and don’t fret about market price fluctuations before I learned the importance of valuing a business and applying a margin of safety.

So, as Charlie said, I got my feet wet with huge failure right away. And —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Join the club. (Laughter)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, I don’t feel so bad now.

So that leads to my question. It seems like I’ve read all the Berkshire reports and all the reading I can do about you two, and I thank you for these wonderful meetings.

But it seems like it boils down to some simple things, valuing a business and applying a margin of safety.

So my question is, what do you recommend for an approach to getting better and better at valuing companies?

WARREN BUFFETT: That was a very, very good question. And in my own case, you know, I started out without knowing anything about valuing companies.

And Ben Graham taught me a way to value a certain type of company that would prove successful, except the universe of those companies dried up.

But nevertheless — it was almost a guarantee against failure, but it was not a guarantee that these things would continue to be available.

Charlie taught me a lot about the value of a durable competitive advantage, and a really first-class business.

But over time, I’ve learned more about various types of businesses. But you’d be amazed how many businesses I don’t feel that I understand well.

The biggest thing is not how big your circle of competence is, but knowing where the perimeter is.

You don’t have to be an expert on 90 percent of the businesses, or 80 percent, or 70, or 50. But you do have to know something about the ones that you actually put your money into, and if that’s a very small part of the universe, that still is not a killer.

And I think if you think about what you would pay for a McDonald’s sandwich, you think you would pay for — you know, think about the businesses in your own hometown of Olathe.

Which would you like to buy into? Which do you think you could understand their economics? Which do you think will be around 10 or 20 years from now? Which do you think it would be very tough to compete with?

Just keep asking yourself questions about businesses. Talk with other people about them.

You will extend your knowledge over time. And always remember that margin of safety. And I think you basically have the right attitude because you recognize your limitations, and that’s enormously important in this business. You will find things to do.

Six or seven years ago — maybe not that long — six or seven years ago, when I was looking at Korean stocks, for example, I never had any idea that Korean stocks would be something that I would be buying.

But I looked over there, and I could see that there were a number of businesses that met the margin of safety test.

And there I diversified, because I didn’t know that much about any specific one, but I knew that a package of 20 was going to work out very well, even if a crook might run one of them, and a couple might run into competition I didn’t anticipate, because they were so cheap. And that was sort of the old Graham approach.

You will find opportunities from time to time, and the beauty of it is you don’t have to find very many of them.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well obviously, if you want to get good at something which is competitive, you have to think about it a lot, and learn a lot, and practice doing it a lot.

And the way the world is constructed in this field, you have to keep learning, because the world keeps changing and your competitors keep learning.

So you just have to get up each morning and try and go to bed that night a little wiser than you were when you got up.

And if you keep doing that for a long time — and accumulate some experience, good and bad, as you try and master what you’re trying to do — people who do that almost never fail utterly.

They may have a bad period when luck goes against them or something. But very few people have ever failed with that.

If you have the right temperament, you may rise slowly but you’re sure to rise.

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie, did you take any business courses in school?

CHARLIE MUNGER: None. I took accounting.

WARREN BUFFETT: And when did you start valuing businesses and how did you go about it?

CHARLIE MUNGER: When I was a little boy. (Laughter)

I can remember, I would come down to the Omaha Club, and there was an old gentleman who hit the Omaha Club about 10:30 every morning. He obviously did almost no work, and yet was quite prosperous.

WARREN BUFFETT: He became your ideal. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. But he made me very curious as a little boy. I said to my father, “How in the hell does he do that?” And he said, “Charlie,” he said, “A business where he enjoys practically no competition. He gathers up and renders dead horses.”

That was an example of avoiding competition by one stratagem. And you keep asking questions like that of reality, starting at a young age, you gradually learn. And weren’t you doing the same thing?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, thankfully he went beyond his original insight there. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: I noticed, it was rather interesting — you take the rulers of the businesses when I was a little boy, an awful lot of those businesses, in Omaha, a lot of those businesses went broke, a lot of them sold out at modest prices under distress.

And some of the people who rose, like Kiewit, from small beginnings, nobody thought of as the great glories of that early time.

And I think that’s kind of the way life is. It’s hard to get anywhere near the top, and it’s hard to hold any position once you’ve attained it.

But I think you can predict that Kiewit was likely to win. They cared more about doing it right. They cared more about avoiding trouble. They put more discipline on themselves.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, if you knew the individual well, you would have bet, right?

CHARLIE MUNGER: What?

WARREN BUFFETT: If you knew the individual.

CHARLIE MUNGER: I would not have bet on any of the people I knew who were already wealthy. But I would have bet on Pete Kiewit. His sister taught me math, and no, half-Dutch, half-German, you know, this is a tough culture. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: There’s your — you just heard it folks. Half-Dutch, half-German. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well but —

WARREN BUFFETT: Go out looking for them. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, the man who’s recommending this is named Munger. (Laughter)

Anyway, the — no — I don’t think it’s that — I was just automatically doing that. What was working, what was failing, why was it working, why was it failing?

If you have that temperament, you are gradually going to learn. And if you don’t have that temperament, I can’t help you. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: If you’d followed Pete Kiewit around for 10 years, you never would have seen him do anything dumb, right?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Oh yeah. It’s so —

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s avoiding the dumb thing. You really don’t have to be brilliant, but, you know, you have to avoid just sort of what almost seem the obvious mistakes.

But I would say that you’re on the right track back there, in terms of having the basic fundamentals, knowing your limitations, but still seeking to learn more about various kinds of businesses.

Charlie, I think, when he practiced law, any client that came in Charlie was thinking about that business as if he owned the place.

And he probably generally thought he knew more about the place than the guy that actually owned it, who was his client. (Laughs)

But I remember talking to him, you know, 50 years ago, and he would start talking about Caterpillar dealerships in Bakersfield or something of the sort. He was incapable of looking at a business without thinking about the fundamental economics of it.

How’d that guy do with the Caterpillar deal? (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, he sold it for a perfectly ridiculous price to a dumb oil company. (Laughter)

It wasn’t worth half what he got for it.

WARREN BUFFETT: But they had a concept and a strategy.

CHARLIE MUNGER: They had a concept and a strategy, and turned out they had consultants. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. (Laughs)

**26. Companies with the best return on capital**

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from Carson Mitchell in Aberdeen, South Dakota, who asks both of you, “What business has had the best return on capital for Berkshire, and what business of any on earth has had the best return on capital?”

And he adds, “PS, I would have come by rail but there are no seats in the grain rail cars.” (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: There’s two ways of looking at it.

If you talk about the capital necessary to run the business, as opposed to what we might have paid for the business — I mean, if we buy a wonderful business — you could run the Coca-Cola Company —assuming you had the bottling systems — you could run it with no capital.

Now, if you buy it for $100 billion, you can look at that as your capital or you can look at the basic capital. When we look at what’s a good business, we’re defining it in terms of the capital actually needed in the business.

Whether it’s a good investment for us depends on how much we pay for that in the end.

There are a number of businesses that operate on negative capital. Carol’s with Fortune magazine. You know, any of the great magazines operate with negative capital.

I mean, the subscribers pay in advance, there are no fixed assets to speak of, and the receivables are not that much, the inventory is nothing.

So a magazine business — my guess is that People magazine operates, or Sports Illustrated operates, with negative capital, and particularly People makes a lot of money.

So there are certain businesses. Well, we had a company called Blue Chip Stamps where we got the float ahead of time, and operated with really substantial negative capital.

But there are a lot of great businesses that need very, very little capital. Apple doesn’t need that much capital, you know.

The best ones, of course, are the ones that can get very large while needing no capital.

See’s is a wonderful business, needs very little capital, but we can’t get people eating ten pounds of boxed chocolates every day.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Except here.

WARREN BUFFETT: We want to. (Laughs)

Generally, the great consumer businesses need relatively little capital. The businesses where people pay you in advance, you know, magazine subscriptions being a case, insurance being a case, you know, you’re using your customer’s capital.

And we like those kind of businesses, but of course, so does the rest of the world, so they can become very competitive in buying them.

We have a business, for example, that’s run wonderfully by Cathy Baron Tamraz, called Business Wire. Business Wire does not require a lot of capital. It has receivables and everything, but it is a service-type business and many of the service-type businesses and consumer-type businesses require little capital.

And when they get to be successful, you know, they can really be something.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I’ve got nothing to add, but at any rate, the formula never changes.

WARREN BUFFETT: If you could own one business in the world, what would it be, Charlie? (Laughter)

I hope we already own them, myself.

CHARLIE MUNGER: You and I got in trouble by addressing such a subject many decades ago.

WARREN BUFFETT: That’s right. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: And I don’t think I’ll come back to it.

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. (Laughter) Number 13 —

CHARLIE MUNGER: If you name some business that has incredible pricing power, you’re talking about a business that’s a monopoly or a near monopoly.

WARREN BUFFETT: Sure.

CHARLIE MUNGER: And I don’t think it’s very smart for us to sit up here naming our most admired business or something, that other people regard as a monopoly.

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. We’ll move right along. (Laughter)

**27. Phone hasn’t been ringing, but we’re still ready to buy**

WARREN BUFFETT: Let’s see, have we done number 13? No, I don’t think so, that’s in the other room again. Anybody there?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger, greetings from the breakout room.

My name is Glenn Tongue from New York. I would like to thank you both for your exemplary stewardship through the economic crisis. We are all wealthier in several ways as a result of your efforts.

I’d like to ask about Berkshire’s growth, specifically your acquisition outlook and appetite. Has the phone been ringing?

WARREN BUFFETT: The phone doesn’t ring very often at Berkshire, you know. That’s partly because — well, we set out our criteria in the annual report for what we’re looking for, and we’re not looking for larger and larger things.

So when we start saying that we want to buy businesses that earn 75 or 100 million, at a minimum, before tax, that weeds out a lot of phone calls.

And I would say that, you know, if we get a couple of — three or four serious phone calls a year that sort of meet our criteria that look like they might be a possibility, that’s a good year, I like that.

I don’t think there’s been any major change in the frequency that something comes along that might interest us.

The answer is, in terms of being interested, we’re as interested as ever. I mean, we wrote a big check and issued shares in connection with BNSF.

But I would love it if Monday morning my phone rings with some big deal. We’ll figure out a way to do it.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it’s amazing to me that we have been as successful as we have been in buying desirable places.

And it’s human revulsion that has helped us, because many of the people who sell to us are so smart that they’re revolted by almost everything else.

They don’t want to sell into some fee-driven buying system that doesn’t care about their employees or their business.

And they finally decide they want to join this one, they don’t want to join the alternatives. And of course, that’s marvelous for us.

We’ve got a screening device out there that is protecting us, to some extent, from the wrong sort of people. And very few people have this particular —

We get offered things by people who would not sell to anybody else. That is really peculiar. And it’s happened what, how many times?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well —

CHARLIE MUNGER: A lot.

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s happened, and on important ones. There’s one I’ve mentioned before, so I can mention the name.

When I heard from ISCAR, and I’d never heard of ISCAR before, I’d never heard of Eitan Wertheimer, who wrote me, but he basically told me and made it quite specific, they either wanted to sell to Berkshire Hathaway or they didn’t want to sell it to anybody.

And we met and we made a deal. And there was another person — I won’t even define exactly the time period — but he came in and he’d been thinking about it for about a year on this business, and he’d built it over many decades.

And he said, “There were three possibilities. One was to sell it to a competitor.” And he said, “They would have ideas immediately about all the people they could take out of this place and move the headquarters,” and everything, and they would dismantle something that he’d spent 30 years or so building.

And he decided that he didn’t want to do that, even though it was probably worth more to a competitor, because that’s often the case, than to anybody else.

And then he looked at selling to a leverage buyout firm — and now would call itself a private equity firm — and he decided he did not want his place being, basically, a piece of meat that would be resold in not that many years. He really wanted to find a permanent home.

So he said, “When I come to you, I don’t come to you because you’re so damned attractive.” He said, “You’re the only guy left.” (Laughter)

And we bought the business. So that happens from time to time, and it’s accidental. It’s when something happens in someone’s life that they decide they really want to assure a permanent home.

It may be because the family isn’t getting along. It may be, you know, a half a dozen reasons. Maybe somebody wants to monetize it because they want to give away a lot of money.

But periodically that will come up, and we are a logical place to get the call, and we will get the calls. But there’s not much we can do to accelerate the process or do anything of the sort.

We are ready to act when it happens. I mean, if I get a call, and it’s a $10 billion deal, on Monday, and I like it, I will say yes. (Laughs)

And then I’ll figure out how we do it.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, I don’t think it’s over. It may be, in fact, it will be, slower than it was in the early days. But that’s not so bad, considering how much richer we all are than we were then.

**28. Big question for Berkshire’s future**

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Since I imagine this may be one of the last questions, Peter Brotchie, a shareholder from Wenham, Massachusetts, writes to say, “Thank you, Warren and Charlie, for improving the Q&A session last year.

“Along those lines, are there important questions that you were surprised that you don’t get asked about Berkshire’s financials or businesses? And if so, what is the question you would ask yourself if the roles were reversed?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well Andrew, first of all, I will say we got a lot of compliments on changing the format. It worked, and that’s why we’re continuing it. So it’s worked very well. (Applause)

And that applause is for you, not for me, and you deserve it.

It really has improved the quality of questions, in terms of having it Berkshire-related and having a system of weeding them out without us being the ones that do the weeding out.

Now, I’ve given Charlie time to think about what the answer to that question is going to be, so I’m going to turn it over to him. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I don’t have a lot of comment about things that should be done differently at Berkshire.

I think it is quite interesting that we got into BYD, because BYD is surfing along on the developing edge of new technology, and that has not — we have always bragged about avoiding that.

Isn’t that a fair statement?

WARREN BUFFETT: That’s fair.

CHARLIE MUNGER: And yet here we are.

I think it’s because we’ve shown some capability for learning. And I think the BYD investment is going to work out very well. And I think it’ll work out very well in a way that gives great pleasure to all of us shareholders, because I think they’re going to help solve some significant problems of the world.

And, that place is — you know, I spoke with pride of Kiewit. They tried harder, they were more self-disciplined. That’s the way I feel about BYD.

And it’s a pleasure to associate with such people, and in my life those are the people with whom I’ve achieved the most.

So as far as I’m concerned, we found our own kind, except they’re better. And we may do more of that.

And we wouldn’t have felt confident enough to go into venture capital, typically with just a bright young man with an idea, no matter how brilliant.

WARREN BUFFETT: Not me.

CHARLIE MUNGER: No, I wouldn’t either.

But BYD had won its spurs in life by the time we found it. They had accomplished things that struck me as almost impossible to do, and yet they’d done them.

And so I don’t think that’s the last unusual thing that Berkshire will do, and the last one that will work.

And I think the Burlington Northern acquisition — when we did it, we knew it would be better for their shareholders than it was for ours, because, after all, they were getting into Berkshire. (Laughter)

But we also thought it was good for our shareholders. And why should we care that it was better for theirs, if it was satisfactory for us? And I think that will happen again, too.

That’s our kind of a culture. You know, Middle Western, and constantly improving the place. And with MidAmerican and Burlington, we’re getting a fair amount of engineering into Berkshire, which of course, I like.

And so I hope you people are comfortable with the way things are going, because I think they’ll keep going in the same direction. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. (Applause) I think they will keep going in the same direction.

But to answer your question on that, Andrew, I would probably ask the question, you know, “Can you keep using all of the capital you generate, effectively, for a very long time?”

And the answer, I think, to that is that even — we will see more things and we will do some more of this. There comes a point where the numbers get big enough that it gets extraordinarily hard to do things that add value.

I mean, if you just play out the numbers, you could see where in 10 or 15 years, not only the capital that’s already accumulated, but the generation of capital in everything, would make it very hard to do things that are, essentially, creating more than a dollar of value per dollar invested.

A portion of the money may be able to be used that way, and likely would be used in the kind of businesses we’re in.

There comes a point where the numbers get too big. And actually, our history is a curve that approaches that point all the time.

It’s turned out to be that now I think we can go a lot further than I would have thought 30 years ago. I mean, it’s just — it’s developed that way. And partly that’s because we see things that I never would have thought we would have seen 30 years ago.

But there is a limit. And there will come a time when we cannot intelligent — in my view — there will come a time when we cannot intelligently use 100 percent of the capital that we develop internally.

And then we’ll do something that’s — whatever is in the most interest — best interest — of the shareholders will be done at that point.

CHARLIE MUNGER: I think we will get into Berkshire, on the investment side — probably starting sooner than many of you expect — people who have some promise of being, well, if not as good as Warren, a decent approximation. And in some cases with abilities that Warren lacks.

In other words, it won’t be all negative. (Laughter)

And so I’m really quite optimistic. (Laughter)

I can see — the reason I think we will succeed at that is because Warren never looks twice at anybody who isn’t a little eccentric, which, of course, is what you’re looking at when you look up here.

WARREN BUFFETT: Living proof, yeah. (Laughter)

**29. “Find your passion, and then don’t let anything stop you”**

WARREN BUFFETT: Well I think we’d better move on to section 1. (Laughs)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello, my name is Joseph Mazzella from Jim Thorpe, PA.

I wanted to first thank Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett, as well as the board of directors for this meeting, as well as the whole shareholder weekend. I’ve had a great time so far.

WARREN BUFFETT: Terrific. (Applause)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Thank you.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: With that, I wanted to share. Aristotle, when asked how to define wealth, answered simply this, “It is he who spends less than he earns.”

What advice could you give a young entrepreneur as myself on how to go about defining and both building wealth within their own business, as I hope to build a business that, one day, you’d be interested in acquiring.

WARREN BUFFETT: I predict you’re going to build one. You know, it may not quite get to the size that — and we’re a moving target as well — but if you start off with that principle you just enunciated, there are probably some other similar principles that you’ll have that we would also agree with.

There’s nothing like following your passion. I mean, I love what I do, obviously, and I’ve loved it the whole time I’ve done it. Charlie is the same way.

We have managers, you know, they come — some of them went to business school, some of them didn’t, you know.

They’re all types. But the common factor in them — they’re successful — the common factor is they love what they do, you know.

And you’ve got to find that in life. And some people are very lucky in finding it very early. It was dumb luck that my father happened to be in the securities business, so when I would go to his office there were a lot of books to read, and I got entranced with that.

But, you know, if he’d been in some other occupation — I think I would have read those books eventually, but it would have been a lot later.

So if you find something that turns you on, my guess is you’re going to do very well in it.

And the beauty of it is, in a sense, there’s not that much competition. There are not a lot of people out there that are going to be running faster than you in the race that you elect to get into.

And if you haven’t found it yet — you may well have found it — but if you haven’t found it yet, you know, you’ve got to keep looking.

And we’ve got 70-plus managers. You know, some of them didn’t — we had one guy that didn’t go to high school, even, didn’t he, Charlie? (Inaudible)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Oh yeah.

WARREN BUFFETT: He quit in fourth grade, I think.

Well, Mrs. B never went to school a day in her life.

And when you go out to the Furniture Mart — I hope you go out this evening, we expect to set a record today in sales (laughter) — what you are looking at on those 78 acres, you know, is the largest home furnishing store, about 400 million in sales. The largest store in the United States, and it comes from $500 of capital paid in by a woman that never went to a day of school in her life and couldn’t read or write.

She loved what she was doing, and, you know, I tell the story, this is a true story.

When she was well into her 90s, she invited me over to her house for dinner. That was very unusual.

And a very nice house, six or seven blocks away from the store. And I went into the house, and the sofa, the chairs, the lamp, the dining room table, they all had little green price tags hanging down. (Laughter)

It made her feel at home. (Laughter)

And I said to her, “Mrs. B, you are my kind of woman.” Forget Sophia Loren and all of that, this is my kind of woman. She loved it.

And she loved it all her life, and just think of what that produced. I mean, it just — it’s incredible.

I mean, you know, one time — my dad used to quote Emerson, that “the power that lies within you is new in nature.”

And basically, the power that was within Mrs. B was new in nature. And over a lifetime it produced amazing things.

So find your passion, and then don’t let anything stop you.

**30. Munger’s fundamental algorithm of life**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, Carol? (Applause)

CAROL LOOMIS: This is a deeply philosophical question. “Many things that you” — the man did not want his name announced — “Many things that you and Charlie do and preach are opposite to those of what people practice and expect.

“For example, you do not change the management of the acquired company, you applaud long-standing employees while others always look for fresh blood and try to fire people as they grow old. You probably do not encourage retirement, while many companies do.

“You do not give large compensation to directors or compensate them using stock options. You do not seem to hire many MBAs. You don’t invest in high tech, but your company has grown very fast.

“You do not provide earnings guidelines. You do not live near New York. You do not like sushi.” (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: That’s the key. (Laughter)

CAROL LOOMIS: “I wonder, what is the fundamental reason for all of these things? In other words, there appears to be a central philosophy here that I am missing.

“I can understand these as isolated principles, but where is the beef? Scientists and philosophers look for a unifying theory when possible.

“What is yours? Is it Buddhism, or Paganism, or something else? Yes, I am looking for your fundamental or unified theory of management in life or fundamental guiding principles.”

WARREN BUFFETT: In ten words or less. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Let me try that one, Warren.

WARREN BUFFETT: Oh good. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: It’s pragmatism. Partly, we do things in our different way because it suits us. And partly, we do it — it suits our temperaments and our natures — and partly, we do it because we’ve found through experience that it works better, at least with us sitting where we sit.

It’s just that simple. And we’ve had enough good sense when something is working very well to keep doing it.

So I’d say we’re demonstrating what might be called the fundamental algorithm of life. Repeat what works.

Is that terse enough for you? (Laughter)

**31. Private high-speed passenger trains aren’t economic**

WARREN BUFFETT: We’ll go on to number 3, I like it. (Laughs)

Or number 2, I’m sorry. Number 2.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon, I am Carolyn Boyle, from Barrington, Illinois.

Thanks for the meeting and thanks everybody from behind the scenes who put this together. It’s quite well orchestrated. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: If I may interrupt you for just one second, that’s very well deserved. And I would to point out that at Berkshire, everybody in our home office — we have 21 of us — they all participate in working at this meeting.

I mean, our CFO works on it — you name anybody in the office — because they enjoy it.

We don’t think we should have a department, you know, for this or that, or the other thing. And I think that’s probably fairly unusual with companies with market caps of close to $200 billion. (Laughs)

But you’ve seen Marc Hamburg walking around here and doing things. It’s a group effort, and they have — I hope they have — fun doing it, because they sure don’t get a bonus for it. (Laughs)

But I think it exemplifies the organization. Thank you, I’m sorry to interrupt you, go ahead.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: That’s OK. Let me share a bit.

I had some trouble getting the annual statement information, so I finally got on the internet and sent in the postcard request a week ago Friday, yesterday, and I got my tickets before the meeting. So it was very well orchestrated.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Now that you own some rail business, I’d like to have your perspective on whether our country needs a high-speed passenger rail service.

And if you think it does, should that be a private or a public endeavor?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I think by its nature, it would be non-economic when it competes with auto and competes with air. We don’t have the point-to-point density and demand that would produce a return on capital.

That just — that is my guess. I made no big study of it. But all of the times I’ve seen projections of the economics of it, it just doesn’t work that well.

So it will be — if it gets done — unless it’s heavily subsidized in some way, which means it’s public anyway — I don’t think it will happen under private — it won’t meet the test of private economics.

Charlie, you know, they’ve got a big proposal in California on this. What do you know about the economics of that?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I know very little, but I’m at least as dubious as you are.

The cost of putting in a high-speed rail system in a place that’s already densely populated is awesomely large. And of course, you’re competing with a system that people prefer.

WARREN BUFFETT: They’re talking about in Omaha —

CHARLIE MUNGER: I’m very skeptical about sticking high-speed rails. I think it’s great in Japan and China.

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s working.

CHARLIE MUNGER: They have a different calculus.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, in Japan, But it worked — yeah.

CHARLIE MUNGER: But putting high-speed rail into Los Angeles just looks to me like a bottomless pit of cost and trouble. And just think of how difficult that would be.

WARREN BUFFETT: If it’s going to be high-speed, it can’t stop very often, you know, by definition. And it can’t go off into spurs and all of these kind of things.

So it really gets to point-to-point operation, and the cost gets staggering. There’s talk in Omaha about a trolley system, and I think — they’re talking about, you know, a couple hundred million dollars or something like that from the federal government.

And the projections of actual revenue are, as I remember, are something like $400,000, and that’s before operating costs.

So the math — you put $200 million into something to move people a few miles in Omaha, and most of the people are going to want to ride their cars. And to have it be efficient it has to be point-to-point, pretty much, for them. I mean, if you start living six blocks one way or eight blocks another way, you say, “Nuts, I’ll take the car.”

The math really gets to be staggering on these things.

And now, you know, everybody figures if you can get the money from the federal government, you know, it doesn’t cost anybody anything. But it would be a lot of money.

It’s been done in Buffalo, and people like it. But I’ve also — I’ve requested the figures on it, and it blows your mind, in terms — I mean, you could give everybody a cab ride or something and it’d be cheaper for society as a whole.

So I have a feeling that it works marvelously, maybe, between Tokyo and Yokohama or something. And it really does. And it even works well enough so I think it justifies private investment.

But it’s tough in a country of, you know, three million-plus square miles, and within the continental lower 48. It’s very tough to make the math work.

Now, if people get — it becomes a huge project or something of the government so it isn’t anybody’s math, you know, maybe it’ll happen. I don’t think it’ll ever happen with money that wants a return.

**32. We can handle claims from a major earthquake**

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This is a question on the insurance portfolio from Jerry Haller (PH).

What would be the impact on insurance companies, and the U.S. economy in general, if an earthquake of the same magnitude that struck Chile were to be focused on Los Angeles or San Francisco?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I don’t know the answer to that. The Richter Scale is not a perfect — it’s far from a perfect — index of the damage caused, even if you tell me where the epicenter will be.

And then you get into the — you know, the big damage in the famous San Francisco quake was the fire following.

They call that — when they distinguish between the — what coverages are involved — they call that the “shake and bake.”

I mean, how much is shake and how much is bake afterwards? (Laughter)

I think it gets hard to get up — I mean, in a really extreme quake — I think it gets hard to get up much more than 100 billion.

You know, a very big quake — the frequency is way less — but if you get up in the Pacific Northwest, you know, there is a possibility of a very high Richter Scale quake there.

And of course, the big ones that we know about — I mean, our history doesn’t go back that far — but New Madrid, Missouri, had three quakes in a relatively short period of time that were all well over eight.

And that will happen again someday, maybe 500 years, you know, maybe 1,000 years, and maybe tomorrow. That’s what the insurance business is all about.

I tend to think — and when I think about quake exposure, sort of worst case in California — I think 100 billion is getting up there.

Northridge caused far more damage than the one that was up near San Francisco a few years earlier.

But we’ll have them. And Berkshire is totally prepared to handle anything that comes along, even if it’s considerably worse than what I’ve —

The worst insured loss — I don’t know whether Katrina came in finally at 70 billion or something like that — I think in terms of a 250 billion sort of worst case.

And my guess is if that came along, and we had a normal year and everything else, Berkshire would still have positive earnings of some substantial amount. So we are prepared.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, and, you know, the big San Francisco quake of whatever it was, ’06, caused a terrible fire. But the recent California quakes, the big ones, have not caused much fire. And a lot of earthquake damage is totally uninsured.

So you might have a hell of a lot of damage without massive — Warren would know more about that than I.

WARREN BUFFETT: So far in Chile —

CHARLIE MUNGER: The earthquake insurance is not universal like fire insurance.

WARREN BUFFETT: Oh no, no, not at all, not at all. And —

CHARLIE MUNGER: So it — an earthquake — a really terrible fire, or terrible wind conditions, it seems to me, catch people worse than the earthquakes.

WARREN BUFFETT: And so far in Chile, as I understand it — and I could be wrong on this and it may not be the way the final numbers come in — but as the numbers have been coming in, something like 40 percent of it has been the tsunami and 60 percent has been the quake, in terms of damage.

But that may well not hold to be — in terms of final figures.

There will be huge catastrophes from time to time. We’re in a different class, in terms of even being able to handle them.

I mean, we’ve got so much earning power outside of the insurance business that if you take a $250 billion quake, or hurricane, or whatever, and we have, probably now, not much more than 3 percent of that — but call it 4 percent — that’d be $10 billion — and, you know, our pre-tax earnings, in any given year, I would expect would be substantially greater than that.

So we would have other — we have net earnings in a year that every other insurance company, you know, would be gasping. So we’re in pretty good shape on that.

**33. “Huge amounts of debt are not going to do us in”**

WARREN BUFFETT: Area 3.

This is probably the last question, and then we’ll go to the business meeting.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name’s Frank Teed and I’m from Arkadelphia, Arkansas.

This is also an insurance-type question, but I did want to thank Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, the board, and in Arkansas we call them the associates — the managers — for your integrity in running Berkshire Hathaway and dealing fairly with the shareholders. So thank you very much.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: We saw in the credit crisis the gross overuse of credit, which led to the big financial meltdown with the government ultimately stepping in.

Now we see a huge increase in debt in our cities, our states, our countries.

For Berkshire Hathaway, what could be our exposure on a global financial meltdown? Could there be correlated risk that could get us in trouble?

You’ve said we have 40 billion in municipal bond insurance. There’s 8 billion to the states, which I’m not sure exactly if that was a municipal bond.

Could a large event cause a large number of losses that was coupled with a decrease in our investments to make an AIG-type situation? Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, if you postulate something where there was a total meltdown, and we essentially made the bet in 2008 there would not be.

It would be unnecessary, but we came close in 2008, and I decided that A) the government could solve the panic that existed, and finally that they would.

There wasn’t any question in my mind they could. The question is, would they get so muddled up, would decision making get paralyzed, would rivalries break out, would, you know, Congress grandstand? All of those sort of things.

And I thought there’d be some of that, but I thought in the end we would do the right thing, which was go all in, which we did.

And that would happen again. So I — if you talk about some massive nuclear, chemical, or biological attack that really does in a very significant proportion of the population or something, you know, who knows what would happen.

But I would say this, that I think Berkshire can withstand anything that any corporation can.

And it won’t be our insurance business that causes a problem. If something extraordinary happens — and I don’t anticipate that at all — but there could be a situation where the world becomes paralyzed.

But I think that having gone through 2008, I think that our government probably better understands the necessity of taking massive action at a time like that.

Doing whatever is necessary — when the guaranteed money market funds, when the guaranteed commercial paper — I mean, when there are things like that, you know, they were sort of unprecedented, and they did them very quickly.

They’d do it again, in my view. There is no reason — the plants of the country don’t disappear, the land doesn’t become less fertile, you know, people don’t become less innovative — things will work unless somehow the gears get all entirely messed up. And I don’t see that happening.

Berkshire, from any insurance catastrophe — and you’re right that things correlate on the downside — when things are bad in one area, they really do spread to another.

But we were built, I think, to withstand anything that — other than a total sort of wipe out of the world. That isn’t going to happen.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I’m not worried about it. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Huge amounts of debt are not going to do us in. That’s one thing I can guarantee you.

I can’t tell you about comets hitting us or something of that sort, but I don’t care how silly governments get in terms of finance, or corporations get, or anything of that sort, that will not harm Berkshire.

I want to thank you all for coming. Charlie and I really appreciate it. (Applause) And thank you.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Thank you. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. I appreciate it, we appreciate that, I’m sure the panel does.

Now we’ll break for about five minutes. Some of you can go shop and some of you will want to stay around for the business meeting, and we’ll start the business meeting in five minutes and we’ll see how long it takes.

**34. Berkshire business meeting begins**

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. I’ve already introduced the Berkshire Hathaway directors.

Also with us today are partners in the firm of Deloitte and Touche, our auditors. They are available to respond to appropriate questions you might have concerning their firm’s audit of the accounts of Berkshire.

Mr. Forrest Krutter is secretary of Berkshire. He will make a written record of proceedings.

Miss Becki Amick has been appointed inspector of elections at this meeting, and she will certify to the count of votes casts in the election of directors.

The main proxy holders for this meeting are Walter Scott and Marc Hamburg.

Does the secretary have a report of the number of Berkshire shares outstanding, entitled to vote, and represented at the meeting?

FORREST KRUTTER: Yes, I do. As indicated in the proxy statement that accompanied the notice of this meeting that was sent to all shareholders of record on March 3, 2010, being the record date for this meeting, there were 1,029,738 shares of Class A Berkshire Hathaway common stock outstanding, with each share entitled to one vote on motions considered at the meeting, and 926,013,086 of Class B Berkshire Hathaway common stock outstanding, with each share entitled to one ten-thousandth of one vote on motions considered at the meeting.

Of that number, 705,611 Class A shares and 566,627,821 Class B shares are represented at this meeting by proxies returned through Thursday evening, April 29th.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. That number represents a quorum, and we will therefore directly proceed with the meeting.

First order of business will be a reading of the minutes of the last meeting of shareholders. I recognize Mr. Walter Scott who will place the motion before the meeting.

WALTER SCOTT: I move that the reading of the minutes of the last annual meeting of the shareholders and the special meeting of shareholders be dispensed with and the minutes be approved.

WARREN BUFFETT: Do I hear a second?

VOICE: I second the motion.

WARREN BUFFETT: The motion has been moved and seconded. Are there any comments or questions?

We will vote on this motion by voice vote. All of those in favor say aye.

VOICES: Aye.

WARREN BUFFETT: Opposed? The motion’s carried.

**35. Election of Berkshire directors**

WARREN BUFFETT: Second item of business is to elect directors. The shareholders present who wishes to withdraw a proxy previously sent in and vote in person on the election of directors, he or she may do so.

Also, if any shareholder that is present has not turned in a proxy and desires a ballot in order to vote in person, you may do so.

If you wish to do this, please identify yourself to meeting officials in the aisles who will furnish a ballot to you. Would those persons desiring ballots please identify themselves so that we may distribute them?

I now recognize Mr. Walter Scott to place a motion before the meeting with respect to the election of directors.

WALTER SCOTT: I move that Warren Buffett, Charles Munger, Howard Buffett, Stephen Burke, Susan Decker, William Gates, David Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman, Donald Keough, Thomas Murphy, Ron Olson, and Walter Scott be elected as directors.

WARREN BUFFETT: Is there a second?

VOICE: I second the motion.

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s been moved and seconded that Warren Buffett, Charles Munger, Howard Buffett, Stephen Burke, Susan Decker, William Gates, David Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman, Donald Keough, Thomas Murphy, Ronald Olson, and Walter Scott be elected as directors.

Are there any other nominations? Is there any discussion? Nominations are ready to be voted upon.

If there are any shareholders voting in person, they should now mark their ballots on the election of directors and allow the ballots to be delivered to the inspector of elections.

Miss Amick, when you’re ready, you may give your report.

BETSY AMICK: My report is ready. The ballot of the proxy holders, in response to proxies that were received through last Thursday evening, cast not less than 756,041 votes for each nominee.

That number far exceeds a majority of the number of the total votes related to all Class A and Class B shares outstanding.

The certification required by Delaware law of the precise count of the votes, including the additional votes to be cast by the proxy holders in response to proxies delivered at this meeting, as well as any cast in person at this meeting, will be given to the secretary to be placed with the minutes of this meeting.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you, Miss Amick.

Warren Buffett, Charles Munger, Howard Buffett, Stephen Burke, Susan Decker, William Gates, David Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman, Donald Keough, Thomas Murphy, Ronald Olson, and Walter Scott have been elected as directors.

**36. Business meeting adjourns**

WARREN BUFFETT: Does anyone have any further business to come before this meeting before we adjourn?

If not, I recognize Mr. Scott to place a motion before the meeting.

WALTER SCOTT: I move this meeting be adjourned.

WARREN BUFFETT: Second?

VOICE: I second the motion.

WARREN BUFFETT: Motion to adjourn has been made and seconded. We will vote by voice. Is there any discussion? If not, all in favor say aye.

VOICES: Aye.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

2011 meeting

Morning session

1. Welcome

WARREN BUFFETT: Good morning. I’m Warren. He’s Charlie.

I can see, he can hear. That’s why we work together. (Laughter)

Have trouble remembering each other’s names from time to time. (Laughs)

We’re going to — we’re going to introduce the directors, we’re going to give you some information on the first quarter earnings.

We’re going to talk briefly about the David Sokol/Lubrizol situation, and then we’re going to open it up for your questions.

Anything as it relates to the Lubrizol matter is going to be transcribed and will be put up on the website — the Berkshire Hathaway website — just as promptly as we can, maybe this evening or this afternoon, maybe tomorrow morning, but very promptly, because we want to be sure that all shareholders hear — or get to read every word of what has been said here about the matter.

2. Board of directors introduced

WARREN BUFFETT: First thing I’d like to do is introduce the directors. And if they’d stand and remain standing, you can withhold your applause as they stand, but you can go crazy at the end, or you can continue to withhold your applause. That will be your call. (Laughter)

Charlie and I are up here, and we don’t like to stand up too often so we’ll skip our standing.

The — Howard Buffett, Stephen Burke, Susan Decker, Bill Gates, Sandy Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman, Don Keough, Tom Murphy, Ron Olson, and Walter Scott. (Applause)

3. Q1 earnings hurt by Asian catastrophes

WARREN BUFFETT: Now, we have a few slides that deal with the first quarter earnings.

I think Marc Hamburg would like me to emphasize that these are preliminary. This is about as early as we ever have a meeting, in relation to the quarter.

Normally it’s always the first Saturday in May, so they had to work a little harder than usual to get these numbers together.

And I will tell you as background that basically pretty much all of our businesses, with the exception of those that are related to residential housing, are getting better, and you can almost see it with most of them quarter by quarter.

We have a wide diversity of businesses. We have more than 70 companies we list, but then Marmon itself has over a hundred businesses. So we are a cross section of not only the American economy, but to some extent we see a fair amount about what’s going on internationally, too.

And in the first quarter, as has been the case, really, since the fall of 2009, both our nonresidential construction businesses, except for those nonresidential construction businesses, our other businesses have generally gotten better quarter by quarter, and there was no exception to that in the first quarter.

What was very different in the first quarter was that we had a — probably the second worst quarter for the insurance industry, in terms of catastrophes around the globe.

Normally, the third quarter of the year is the worst period because that’s when hurricanes tend to hit the U.S. with most of them — well, about 50 percent of them occurring in September and then sort of forming a normal curve on either side of September — so the third quarter usually is the record quarter, and the third quarter was the record quarter back at the time of Katrina.

But in the first quarter of this year, we had some major catastrophes in the Pacific Asian areas, and that hit the reinsurance industry particularly hard.

No one knows at this point. I mean it’s a wild guess, but probably those catastrophes cost the reinsurance industry on the order of $50 billion, and we usually participate to the extent of 3 to 5 percent.

First of all, I’ll give you our overall earnings the way we normally present them. And if we’ll put the first slide up.

You can see that our insurance underwriting suffered an after-tax loss of $821 million.

Now, when I wrote the annual report, I postulated normal earning power of Berkshire at about 17 billion pretax and about 12 billion after tax, assuming breakeven on insurance underwriting.

Our insurance underwriting has done better than breakeven. In fact, it’s made quite a bit of money for eight consecutive years.

But I would say with a start of these catastrophes in the first quarter — or the catastrophes experience we had in the first quarter — I would say that it’s unlikely that we would have an underwriting profit for 2011.

If it was remarkably catastrophe-free from this point forward, including hurricanes in the United States, it’s conceivable we would break even or make a tiny profit.

But that’s an improbable assumption, so I think for the first time in nine years we will likely have an insurance underwriting loss this year.

I think our record may very well be quite a bit better than, certainly, most other reinsurers and it does not change my expectation that over time, our insurance underwriting should at least break even. And if you have followed the — what I’ve written in the annual reports — if insurance breaks even, we get the free use of float, and that’s been enormously valuable in the past and I would expect it to be in the future.

And if you look at the other lines, insurance investment income is down a little. That will go down more because our Goldman Sachs preferred was called in April.

Our General Electric preferred is almost certain to be called in October. So we have lost — and we lost a — we had called a note from Swiss Re that was paying us 12 percent and came to something over $360 million a year when the Swiss franc went above par.

So we have lost, or are losing, at least three very high-yield investments, which we cannot replace with similar investments at present. So that line will go down.

On the other hand, at the end of the quarter we had 38 billion in cash, and that does not count the 5 1/2 billion that we were going to receive in April from our Goldman Sachs preferred. So that money is earning virtually nothing now, and I would not expect that to be part of the long-term picture, either.

So there would — you know, just a few percent on that would be many, many hundreds of millions of dollars.

So I think over time, our insurance investment income, even though it will dip throughout this year, I would expect that if we have a similar level of investments, to actually grow from the level we show here.

We had the full ownership of BNSF in the quarter this year. We only had it, I think, from February 12th last year, so that, in a significant way, accounts for the gain in that next line of railroad, utilities and energy.

But the BNSF also had a significant gain in earnings and the railroad business looks to me like it will have a very good year this year, not just our railroad but all railroads, and the competitive advantage of railroads is becoming more and more evident, almost by the day, particularly as fuel prices increase.

And in the remaining lines, we also had gains in most of our businesses.

So overall, we got hit very hard in the insurance business.

And if we’ll move to slide 2, we list the three major catastrophes that occurred, which in aggregate we estimate we have a total loss of a billion, 673 pretax, and that figure, as with all estimates — early estimates about major catastrophes — is subject to a lot of change. Nobody knows what the insured losses will be from the Japanese earthquake.

But this is our best estimate now. You’ll notice that over 40 percent of the underwriting loss comes from a contract we have with Swiss Re where we get 20 percent of their business.

That contract is in the fourth of its five years. They have indicated that they will not be interested in renewing it. I just wish they told us that a few months ago. (Laughs)

But we’ve enjoyed the relationship with Swiss Re, it’s just that we enjoy it some quarters more than others.

Our estimate — we’ve added a little something into their estimate because on balance we feel that most catastrophe losses develop upward. It’s sort of the nature of the business.

But that — incidentally, the tornadoes in April, just at GEICO, we expect — and all we’re talking about is automobiles here, cars, because we don’t insure homeowners. We act as agent in placing insurance for people, but we do not take the insurance risk.

We estimate that 25,000 cars will get automobile claims. That’s a lot of automobiles when you think about it, and our market share is about 9 percent, although it varies by state.

But it’s been an extraordinary tornado season, as you know. That does not hit — I do not believe that that hits the reinsurance business particularly hard, because there are multiple, multiple events but no one event is anything like, say, the New Zealand earthquake.

The New Zealand earthquake estimated at $12 billion of insured damage. Charlie, how many people are in New Zealand?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well —

WARREN BUFFETT: We don’t practice these things, as will become evident here. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: I’d guess —

WARREN BUFFETT: What, about four million? Three million?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I’d guess a little more than that.

WARREN BUFFETT: Four?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Five, maybe.

WARREN BUFFETT: Five, OK. Five million people. So that’s 1/60th of the population, we’ll say, of the

United States. And if you take 12 billion and multiply it by 60, you come up with 720 billion, which is 10 times Katrina, in terms of the impact on a place like that.

So those — there’s been some really extraordinary earthquakes. And as I say, the worst part of the season is, generally speaking, for reinsurers, is yet to come. So this may be a year that the reinsurers will remember, although they might prefer to forget it.

There’s some good news on the insurance front. On the next slide I show the growth in policies at GEICO month by month this year versus last year.

Now, if you’ll remember, in the annual report I gave an explanation, in talking about goodwill value, about how the goodwill of GEICO is carried on our books at about a billion dollars. And no matter how successful the business becomes, that goodwill value is never increased on the books, but it does grow.

And as I put in the annual report, I estimate its value currently, using the same sort of yardstick we used when we purchased the second half of the company back in 1995, I estimate that value has grown, maybe, to 14 billion.

I mean, every policyholder at GEICO, on average, has a value to us, the way I calculate it, of something on the order of $1,500.

And when we add 318,000 — and as of yesterday it was up to 381,000 — when we add that, we’ve added something approaching $500 million to the goodwill value.

That does not count the earnings from underwriting, which were substantial for GEICO. That does not count the investment income from the float, it does not count the investment income from the net worth we have attributed to it. That is added goodwill value, the same sort of goodwill value that a Coca-Cola has, or a Mars has, or any company like that.

And people think of it differently when they think of most consumer products. But a policyholder to Berkshire at GEICO has very, very significant value.

There’s a very significant percentage have been there for 10 years or more. And it’s something that we do not realize on our balance sheet or income account, but it’s an asset that’s every bit as real as the numbers that we do put on the balance sheet.

So there’s good news at GEICO. We are gaining market share every day.

As a matter of fact, if you think about it, we have some people in the adjacent room that will be glad to sell you GEICO policies, and if only 66 of you sign up, that’s a goodwill value of about $100,000, so it will take care of some of the expenses of this meeting. (Laughter)

Not that I care whether you do it or not but — (Laughs)

Now, there’s one more item I want to go through on the earnings picture, just because it illustrates to some extent the capriciousness of accounting and how we value our securities — or whether we take write-downs on them, I should say.

There’s something called “other than temporary impairment,” which is an accounting rule. It’s kind of a fuzzy accounting rule, but it says that if you own a security for a while, and you paid X for it, and it’s been selling at, say, 80 percent of X for quite a while, nobody knows exactly what quite a while means, and I’m sure they phrase it differently in the accounting textbooks, but anyway, if it sells there for quite a while, you’re supposed to mark it down to that new valuation and have that markdown go through your income account, through your profit and loss account.

Now we mark it down in any event for the balance sheet, and the balance sheet is what gives you the number for book value and is our reference point.

But only when it meets this other than temporary thing does the mark down actually get run through the profit and loss account.

Now, on March 31, as is shown, I believe, on the next slide, we owned some Wells Fargo stock, which had a cost of about 8 billion and the market value was 11.3 billion.

But some of the Wells Fargo stock we bought had been bought at higher prices than the March 31 figure, whereas, as you can see, a lot of the stock, which had a gain in it of 3.7 billion, had been bought at lower prices.

Well, under the rules, we were required to mark down the stock we bought at a higher price by 337 million, whereas we ignored, in the income account, the 3.7 billion of gain.

Now, interestingly enough, there’s two ways you can account for securities, as I understand it, both fully meeting GAAP accounting requirements. And if we had — if we had used the average cost method, we would not have had to mark down.

But we use what they call the specific identification method. Now the specific identification method is actually useful to us from a tax standpoint, because it means whenever we sell a security we can pick out the highest priced security and attribute the sale to that.

So it actually saves us money, or the time use of money, to get into specific identification.

But we could just as easily use the average cost method and then we would not have a write-down like we have and that’s why I — one of the reasons I emphasize that — the fact that you should ignore gains or losses in securities or derivatives on a quarterly basis, or even an annual basis.

The important thing is what the operating earnings of our businesses are doing and what the gain in book value, generally, has been.

And then on top of that, you have to make your own estimate for what intrinsic value is, which would include things like the goodwill value that has been developed at GEICO.

I apologize for taking you through the accounting lessons, but the headlines often just say what the final net income is, as if that’s the all-important figure. And sometimes it’s the all-deceptive figure.

I mean, it really bears — if you include gains and losses — it bears, really, no connection to the reality of whether a quarter has been satisfactory from our standpoint.

But it does get a lot of attention in the press and that’s why we spend, perhaps, an inordinate amount of time trying to explain what really takes place in our financials.

Now, I think we’re going to get to the questions and answers here in just a second. We’ll alternate between the press group on my right and 13 stations that — microphones that have been placed. I think a dozen of them in this room and maybe one in one of the overflow rooms.

4. David Sokol and Lubrizol: “inexcusable” and “inexplicable”

WARREN BUFFETT: I’d like to just comment for a few minutes — and this will be transcribed and up on the internet at our web page — I’d like to comment for just a few minutes, and I’d like to ask Charlie then to give his thoughts, on the matter of David Sokol and the purchase of Lubrizol stock.

You saw in the movie a clip from the Salomon situation, and that occurred almost 20 years ago. It will be 20 years ago this August.

And at the time, it was a Sunday, Charlie was there, and I was elected the chairman at — what, about 3:00 in the afternoon or so I think on a Sunday at Salomon, and I went down to address a press group.

And almost the first — somewhere in the early questions, somebody sort of asked me, you know, what happened?

Well, A) I’d just gotten to Salomon fairly recently, so I didn’t know too much about it, but the phrase that came out of my mind then — out of my mouth then — sometimes my mind and my mouth are coordinated — (laughter) — the phrase that came out of my mouth then was that what happened was inexplicable and inexcusable.

Now, it’s 20 years later, and looking back on Salomon, I still find what happened inexplicable and inexcusable. You know, I will never understand exactly why some of the events that transpired did transpire.

And to some extent, in looking at what happened a few months ago with Dave Sokol’s failure to notify me at all that he’d had any kind of contact with Citigroup. In fact, he directed my attention to the fact that they represented Lubrizol and never said a word about any contact with them.

And then the purchases of stock immediately prior to recommending Lubrizol to Berkshire, I think I — for reasons that are laid out in the audit committee report, which I urge you to read and which is on our website — I don’t think there’s any question about the inexcusable part that Dave violated, and that the code of ethics, he violated our insider trading rules, and he violated the principles I laid out — I lay out — every two years in a direct personal letter to all of our managers and which I’ve been doing for a long time. So I — you can read the audit committee report about that.

The inexplicable part is somewhat — well, it’s inexplicable, but I’d like to talk about it a little bit because I will tell you what goes through my mind in respect to it.

Certainly — well, one interesting point is that Dave, to my knowledge, at least, made no attempt to disguise the fact that he was buying the stock. I mean, you know, you read about insider trading cases and people set up trusts in Luxembourg, or they use neighbors who know neighbors, or they use third cousins — I mean, they have various ways of trying to buy the stock so that when it’s later — FINRA is a supervising organization — looks at the trading activity in the months prior to a deal, they do not see names that jump out at them as being associated with the deal.

To my knowledge, Dave did nothing like that, so he was leaving a total record as to his purchases.

Now, I think at least usually — and maybe always — we are queried after any deal. We are asked who knew about it when, and we supply a list of whether it’s people at the law firm or people that are in a secretarial position at our place or the law firm.

We give them a list of everybody that might have known or did know about the deal prior to the public announcement. And I don’t know whether they do that 100 percent of the time, but certainly it’s my experience that you get that.

And then a while later, you get a list of names of people that FINRA, again, has picked up as trading it, and they ask you whether any of those names ring a bell with you. So they’re trying to put together whether anybody did any inside trading ahead of time.

So the odds that if you’re trading in your own name, and you’re on that list of people who know of a deal ahead of time, the odds that it’s not going to get picked up seem to me are very much against you.

But, to my knowledge, Dave did not disguise the trading. Which, you know, that’s somewhat inexplicable that if he really felt he was engaging in insider trading and knew the penalties that could be attached to it, that he essentially did it right out in the open.

The second fact, which is less — perhaps less — puzzling, but Dave obviously has a net worth in very high numbers. He made, I think, close to $24 million. He earned it from Berkshire last year, and we got our money’s worth, but he did get $24 million, too.

So I would say that there are plenty of activities in this world that are unsavory that are committed by people with lots of money.

So I don’t regard that as, you know, totally puzzling. But I will give you one instance that does make it puzzling. It makes it very puzzling to me.

We bought MidAmerican at the end — Berkshire Hathaway bought MidAmerican — at the end of 1999. Berkshire Hathaway bought about 80 percent.

Walter Scott, who I just introduced, and his family was the second largest holder, I think something over 10 percent, and then two operating people, Dave Sokol the senior one, owned or had options on a big piece, and Greg Abel, a terrific partner of Dave’s, also had a piece.

And Walter Scott — and I’ve told this story privately a few times but not — I don’t think I’ve done it publicly.

Walter Scott came to me a year or two after we’d bought it, and Walter said, I think we ought to have some special compensation arrangement for Dave and Greg if they perform in a really outstanding manner. And he said — I think maybe he suggested something involving equity and he saw me turn white.

So he said, “Why don’t you design one and let me know.” So I just scribbled something out on a yellow pad. It didn’t take me five minutes.

And we call it, sort of in honor of Charlie, although he didn’t know about it, we called it the Lollapalooza.

And it provided for a very large cash payout, which I’ll get to in a second, based on the five-year compounded gain in earnings. And we were starting from a high base, in other words this was not from any depressed level, and we set a figure that no other utility company in the United States was going to come close to.

But if that figure were achieved, we were going to give $50 million to Dave and $25 million to Greg Abel.

And I had Dave come to the office and I said, “Here’s what Walter and I are thinking,” and, “What do you think of this plan?”

And it had these figures on per share that — that like I say, move forward at 16 percent compounded per year, and then I say, “Here’s the payout.”

And he looked at it for just a very short period of time and he said — he said, “Warren, this is more than generous.” But he said, “There’s just one change you should make.”

And I said, “What’s that?” And he said, “You should split it equally between me and Greg, instead of being 50 million for me and 25 for Greg. It should be 37 1/2 apiece.”

So I witnessed — and Walter witnessed, you can talk to him about it — we witnessed Dave voluntarily, without any — Greg had nothing to do with it, he wasn’t there — we saw Dave transfer over 12 1/2 million dollars — getting no fanfare, no credit whatsoever — to his, in effect, junior partner.

And I thought that was rather extraordinary, and what really makes it extraordinary is that $3 million, you know, 10 or so years later, would have led to the kind of troubles that it’s led to.

I find — that is really the fact that I find inexplicable, and I think I’ll probably — you know, it’s 20 years after Salomon — 20 years from now Charlie will be 107 — (laughter) — and we won’t mention what I’ll be — but I think 20 years from now, I will not understand what causes a man to voluntarily turn away 12 1/2 million dollars to an associate without getting any credit for it in the world, and then 10 or so years later, buy a significant amount of stock the week before he talked to me.

And when he talked to me about Lubrizol, it was either the 14th or 15th — he says it was 14th, I have no reason to disagree with that. The only reason I couldn’t say specifically was I had eight university groups, 160 students, in on that Friday. That’s the only thing that shows, and I spent most of the day with them.

And the 10K and the 10Q that got printed out on Saturday have that date on them, the 15th, when I looked at Lubrizol for the first time.

You might be interested in knowing, I’ve been looking up 10Ks and 10Qs for 20 or 30 years, but I don’t know how to print them out. So, fortunately, Tracy Britt was in the office, and I said, “Tracy, would you print this damn thing out? I don’t know how to do it yet.” (Laughter)

But that is why I don’t know whether it was the 14th or the 15th. The 10Q says the 15th.

But, at that time, when Dave called me on it, he said nothing about contact with Citigroup or anything of the sort and he — and I said, “I don’t know anything, really, about the company.” He said, “Well, take a look at it. It — you know, it might fit Berkshire.”

And I said, “How come?” And he said, well — he said, “I’ve owned it and it’s a good company. It’s a Berkshire-type company.”

And, you know, I obviously made a big mistake by not saying, “Well, when did you buy it?”

But I think if somebody says I’ve owned the stock, you know it sounds to me like they didn’t buy it the previous week.

So there we are with a situation, which is sad for Berkshire, sad for Dave, still inexplicable in my mind, and we will undoubtedly get more questions on that. We’ll be glad to answer them.

Charlie, do you have any thoughts on this?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I think it’s generally a mistake to assume that rationality is going to be perfect, even in very able people. (Laughter)

We prove that pretty well, regularly.

WARREN BUFFETT: Do you have any explanation for the irrational?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. I think hubris contributes to it.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we’ve gotten quite a bit out of him, folks. (Laughter)

5. Journalists introduced

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Let’s go to work.

We’ll start with Carol Loomis of Fortune Magazine. I might as well — I should introduce our group here.

Oh, we didn’t go alphabetical this time. We’ve got Carol, and then we’ve got Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times, and we have Becky Quick of CNBC. (Applause)

In terms of my check-off system, I’m still going to go to Becky. That’s alphabetical.

So, Andrew, it didn’t do you any good to try to move over there into the center spot. (Laughs)

Carol, you’re on.

CAROL LOOMIS: Good morning from all of us, and I will make the small preamble that I’ve made before.

We’ve been getting questions for a couple of months, each of us on our e-mail.

Sometimes a question will be sent to all three of us and sometimes they’ll just send to one of us, therefore it becomes very hard to count how many we’ve had, but certainly it’s in the many hundreds and probably in the — up into a thousand, 2000.

And obviously we aren’t going to be able to ask every question — every good question. We have a lot of good questions we won’t be able to get to. But it’s just that you had to pick and choose.

And the other thing I should say is that whatever we do ask, Warren and Charlie have no idea of the question. None. No hint.

WARREN BUFFETT: Sometimes we have no idea of the answer either, but go ahead. (Laughter)

6. Buffett’s David Sokol timeline

CAROL LOOMIS: So I will begin. I don’t think that anybody will be surprised that it is a Sokol question.

And actually, the — this particular long-term shareholder believed, as Warren has believed, he says, “I do not see why he should have been expected to ask Sokol about his Lubrizol stock holdings when he said he owned the stock. That wouldn’t have been a natural question.

“But when you found out the details of his stock purchases a short time later, I do not understand your reaction.

“Surely you realized immediately that these facts were going to become known and that they were going to damage Berkshire’s reputation, something you had said repeatedly you would be ruthless in protecting.

“Being ruthless probably would have meant your firing Sokol on the spot, but you didn’t do that.

“And then you put out a press release that many Berkshire shareholders that I have talked to found totally inadequate.

“You have always been very direct in stating things. You were not direct in that press release, except in praising David Sokol. Otherwise you stated some facts and behavior that you said you didn’t believe was illegal.

“And then you ended the release, leaving us — now maybe you thought somehow we were going to read between the lines — without expressing any anger about what had happened. Why were you not incensed?

“If you were, why did you not express your anger? Why did you handle this matter in the inadequate way you did?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. The — (applause) — it wasn’t really immediately thereafter. I learned on March 14th, which was the day we announced it. Now bear in mind his first conversation when he said he owned the stock was January 14th.

In between January 14th and March 14th, Dave gave no indication that he’d had any contact with Citigroup of any kind, and as we learned later, I mean, he went — they met in, maybe, October or something like that where — and talked about possible acquisition candidates for Berkshire.

But none of that — he told me at one point, he said Evercore and Citi represent Lubrizol. One of them represents the directors and one of them represents the company, and not a word about any contact.

On March 14th, when the deal was announced in the morning, I got a call from John Freund. John Freund is probably here today. John Freund works for Citi in Chicago, and he handles — he’s handled the great majority of our business in equities for decades, and I’ve got a direct line to him. I talk to him frequently.

And he called and said congratulations and — you know and aren’t you proud of our — words to the effect. You can talk to John directly, although I’ve been told that the Citi lawyers have told him not to talk, but that — knowing the press, they probably can work something out of him.

The — he’s — essentially his words were that Citi’s team had worked with Dave on this acquisition, and they were proud to be part of it, et cetera, et cetera.

And this was all news to me, so that set up some yellow lights, at least. And the next day, I had Marc Hamburg, our CFO, call Dave, and Dave readily gave him the information about when he had bought the stock and how much.

Marc also asked him what the participation of Citi had been in reference to Berkshire’s side of the transaction, and Dave said that he thought he called a fellow there to get their phone number, which turned out to be somewhat of an understatement.

Now, during the period when we announced the deal on March 14th, Lubrizol is the one that needed to prepare a proxy statement. We were not issuing shares at Berkshire. So there was no proxy statement, no — nothing of this — that sort — on our part.

The Lubrizol legal team, Jones Day, went to work with Lubrizol management to start preparing the proxy statement.

We eagerly awaited to see the first draft of that because I was going to be leaving for Asia on Saturday, which, I guess, would be the 19th, and I wanted to see what Lubrizol had to say about this whole Citi matter or anything else.

The most interesting part of every proxy statement is something that says — it’s basically the history of the transaction, and it’s the first thing I read on any deal because it gives you a blow-by-blow of what has taken place.

And as Marc Hamburg can tell you, I kept — and our law firm can tell you — I kept urging them to get that to me before I took off for Asia.

We got that the afternoon of Friday the 18th, and it had a fair amount of material in it about Dave’s involvement with Citigroup.

Then at that point — I believe it was at that point — our law firm got involved, Munger Tolles got involved, in their input to the Lubrizol lawyers as to what we had seen that was different or what we had seen that they didn’t know about that we could add.

Ron Olson, the director of Berkshire and partner of Munger Tolles, was on the trip to Asia. So we got on the plane on Saturday the 19th and traveled over the next week until the 26th.

And we knew at that point that his partners at Munger Tolles were interviewing Dave, as — maybe some other people too, but certainly Dave — and I believe that he was interviewed at least three times about both the stock purchases, the history of things with — of his relationship with Citigroup, and they were assembling this information.

I don’t have a BlackBerry or whatever it may be. Ron does. So he would get some information as we were over there. And he was getting some input but — and we decided that when we got back we would need to have a prompt meeting of the Berkshire board about this matter.

And we would also learn what — the full details, at least — of what Bob Denham, and maybe other attorneys at Munger Tolles learned from their interviews with Dave.

And we back on — I guess it would be Saturday the 26th — and on the 28th we were going to bring Charlie into it before calling a board meeting.

But there would have been a board meeting that week. And then about five or so in the afternoon, a letter was delivered by Dave’s assistant, which really came out of the blue.

And I — he said to me he felt he was retiring on a high point and he gave the reasons why he was retiring, which I laid out and so on.

I don’t know whether the questioning the previous week had affected his attitude. He would say not.

But in any event, we had that resignation. That resignation as is — I believe it may have been put in the audit committee report — may have saved us some money.

If we’d fired him, the question would be whether it was with cause or not with cause, and we would have said it was with cause, but that might have very well gotten litigated, and a retirement did provide, in effect, the same non-level of severance payments that a firing with cause provided.

So I drafted up a press release, which has since been the subject of at least mild criticism — (laughs) — and I laid out the good things that Dave had done, which he had done for the company. He’d done many good things, some extraordinary things.

And then I laid out some actions which I said, based on what I knew then, did not seem to me to be unlawful, and incidentally, I talked with both Charlie and Ron about that.

Ron would have been more careful in that wording. I’m not sure Charlie would have been. I’ll let him speak for himself on that.

And we ran it by — I ran it by Dave Tuesday morning, just to be sure the facts were accurate, and he said — he objected very much to something I’d put in where I said that I thought that he was, in effect, had had his hopes dashed for succeeding me and that was part of the reason, and he said that was absolutely not true, that he had no hopes ever of succeeding me and that I — you know, basically he was telling me what was in his mind, and I shouldn’t be trying to second-guess what was in his mind.

So I took that part out. But he affirmed all of the other facts in that letter, and then I took it out, I sent it to him a second time to make sure that he was OK with the facts, and he said they were accurate.

Now, in there was included the fact that Dave had no indication that Lubrizol had any interest in an approach from Berkshire and that, at least according to the final Lubrizol proxy, is not the case.

I have not talked to anybody except John Freund at Citigroup, so I have no idea what took place with the investment bankers at Citigroup, except for what I read in the Lubrizol proxy. But the Lubrizol proxy now says that Dave did know that Lubrizol had an interest on December 17th.

But, both in the two chances he had to review it, and then when he went on CNBC on a Thursday and he talked for a half an hour, he made no attempt to correct any of the facts in it.

Now, on Wednesday, when we put out the report, we had to have a board meeting first. It was news to the board. They got the release a little bit ahead of time and then we had a board meeting.

We also delivered — well, through our law firm, we phoned the head of the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission and told him exactly the facts regarding the stock purchases and anything else that they might have cared to know.

So I think we acted in that case, very, very promptly, to make sure the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the top of the enforcement division, was well-versed on what had taken place, to our knowledge up to that point.

So, from our standpoint and my standpoint, Dave was gone, minimum severance costs, minimum chances for lawsuits about compensation due him, and we had turned over some very damning evidence, in my view, to both the public and to the SEC.

What I think bothers people is that there wasn’t some big sense of outrage or something in the release, and, you know, I plead guilty to that.

I — this fellow had done a lot of good things for us over 10 or 11 years, and I felt that if I’m laying out a whole bunch of facts that are going to create lots of problems for him for years to come, that I also list his side of the equation, in terms of what he’d done for Berkshire.

And I — and as I said a little bit earlier, you know, one thing I didn’t even lay out was this extraordinary act where, in effect, he turned over 12 1/2 million dollars to a fellow employee.

So that’s the history of my thinking on it.

Charlie, do you want to add anything? (Applause)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. Well, I think we can concede that that press release was not the cleverest press release in the history of the world. (Laughter)

The facts were complicated, and we didn’t foresee, appropriately, the natural reaction.

But I would argue that you don’t want to make important decisions in anger. You want to display as much ruthlessness as your duty requires, and you do not want to add one single iota because you’re angry.

So, Tom Murphy, one of our best directors — (applause) — one of our best directors, always told the people at Cap Cities, you can always tell a man to go to hell tomorrow if it’s such a good idea. (Laughter)

So the anger part of it — and I don’t think it was wrong to remember the man’s virtues as well as his error. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: I might add as an aside, Charlie and I have worked together for 52 years, and we have disagreed on a lot of things. We’ve never had an argument.

I need Tom Murphy’s advice to remind myself of it a lot of times on other things, but with Charlie it’s never even been necessary. It was long before I met Murph.

7. Market reaction when Fed ends stimulus

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Let’s go to area 1.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mary Broderick, Berkeley, California. Good morning, Mr. Buffett. Good morning, Mr. Munger. And a big thank you. You probably aren’t aware of this, but you’ve been my personal financial and investment advisors for years.

I would like to know what you think the effect of the government ending the POMO program mid-July this year will have on the stock market and the economy in general.

WARREN BUFFETT: The government ending the — QE2 or —

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Permanent open market operation.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you’re one acronym ahead of me. (Laughter)

The — well, just as we’re discussing it now, it’s no secret what they’re going to do.

I mean, it’s sort of the most advertised open market purchase in history, and probably in terms of defining the amount per month and when it comes to an end, you know, what the balance sheet will look like at the end of the Fed.

So I don’t think — you know, if something is that well known by all participants in a market, I think any effect of it has been discounted by this point in time.

I mean, if you say you’re going to increase tax rates in a year, we’ll say, on corporations or decrease them or whatever it may be, and it’s really done and locked in stone, the market doesn’t wait until the date when the tax increases or decreases go through to build that into market prices. So I don’t — I see no reason — there may be some other things that happen then — but I see no reason why simply having that program come to an end will cause any significant change in stock or bond markets at that time.

You know, obviously, a huge market force will be withdrawn.

I mean you buy $600 billion worth of Treasurys and, you know, you probably leave a few traces along the way that you’ve done it. And it has been 100 billion or so a month, and that purchasing will not be in the market but the government issuances of debt will still be at a level that are consistent with what they are now.

So it will be a different market, but I think it’s a different market that’s already been anticipated.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I have nothing to add. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yep.

8. Role of Berkshire’s next chairman

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: I’d like to ask a question that comes from Ron Taracant (PH) from Sugar Land, Texas.

He says, “Good morning, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. You have always put great emphasis on hiring and retaining managers that not only have exceptional talent but also adhere to the higher standards of corporate ethics and behavior.

“Recent events surrounding Mr. Sokol’s actions have demonstrated that we were not very far from a situation where someone running Berkshire Hathaway had great talent, but lacked the other quality that has made Berkshire the envy of the business world.

In some ways, we are relieved these events happened when you were still at the helm.

But coming back to the succession plan that you have in place, how can you ensure that there are no more Sokols in the lineup of successional managers that you have.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, he made an assumption there about Sokol being the next in line, which I’m not sure was warranted.

But he certainly was entitled to think that he was a candidate. And there are — that is, one of the reasons that I think it’s a good idea if my son, Howard Buffett, who would have no — get paid nothing, and have no activities in the company, be the chairman after I’m not around, because you can make a mistake in selecting a CEO.

I mean, I think the odds of us making a mistake are very, very low. And certainly the candidate that I think is the leading candidate now, I wouldn’t — I would lay a lot of money on the fact that he is straight as an arrow.

But mistakes can be made. You know, the — the Bible says the meek shall inherit the earth, but the question is, will they stay meek? (Laughter)

The idea of having an independent chairman, who would be voting a lot of stock — because even at my death, because of the concentration of A stock and so on, the executors would have a very significant block of stock — and if some mistake were made, it would be easier to change if not only a very large block of stock were available to express an opinion, but also if the chairmanship was not locked in with the CEO.

It’s gotten less tough to change CEOs at companies where either their moral or their intellectual qualities are found lacking, but it’s still difficult.

If — you know, it’s particularly difficult if they turn out to be a mediocre CEO. If the person is really bad, you know, people will rise up sometimes and — particularly if they have meetings without the CEO present.

But it’s not an easy job to displace a sitting CEO who also holds the chairman’s position and controls the agenda and all of that.

So I think an independent chairman, particularly one that represents a very large block of stock, and has no designs himself on taking over the place, is a safety measure for the possibility, however remote, that the wrong decision is made.

But I will tell you that the directors at Berkshire will be thinking every bit as much about the quality of the person as a human being as they will be thinking about their managerial skills, because it’s vital that you have somebody at Berkshire, in my view, that is running the place that really cares more about Berkshire than he does about himself, in terms of advancement.

And I think we have multiple candidates that fulfill that. And the idea of an independent chairmanship is a — is, you know, part of the belt and suspenders.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, you know, your idea about the Buffett family has a precedent.

The Rockefellers left the management of Standard Oil many, many decades ago, and they — but they did intervene once, and that was to throw out, what was it, the head of Standard of Indiana, and it was on moral grounds.

So that sort of thing can happen and you have put another string in our bow.

9. Picking tech stocks is difficult but could be profitable

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. We’ll go to area 2.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Caroline Tile (PH), Boston, Massachusetts.

Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, if you were going to live another 50 years, and we sincerely hope you do, and could add one additional sector or asset class to your circle of competence, which sector would it be and why?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, that’s a very good question, and I particularly like the preamble. (Laughter)

Well, you would — you would certainly pick a sector that’s large, because it isn’t going to make any difference to Berkshire if we get to be experts on some tiny little industry or business.

I would say that — that, you know, it would have to be something in the — this isn’t going to happen — but if I could really become expert — and I mean really expert, knowing more than most — almost anybody else about the subject — in the tech field, you know, I think that that would be terrific.

It isn’t going to happen, but it’s going to be a huge field.

There are likely to be, you know, a few enormous winners, a lot of disappointments. So that the ability to pick the winners, you know, is far disproportionate to the ability to pick the winners, we’ll say, among integrated major oil companies where they’re all equated in price.

You’re not going to have a big edge in trying to pick Chevron against Exxon against Continental and Occidental, and you name it.

But the degree of disparity in results among larger tech companies in the future is likely to be very, very dramatic. And if I had the skills where I could pick the winners there I would do a lot better than if I had the skills to pick the winners in the major integrated oil field.

You probably will have better luck with Charlie on this one because he knows a lot more about a lot of industries than I do. Charlie, what’s your answer?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, it would either be tech or energy. And I think that we’re the wrong people to develop the expertise. (Laughter)

I think if we were going to do it, it would have already happened.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

CHARLIE MUNGER: I do think we might identify someone else who has abilities that we lack. That’s been very hard for us but — (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: We’re not going to tell you. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: But we’ve done a little better lately.

WARREN BUFFETT: That’s a good question.

10. Why Buffett got past his skepticism about Lubrizol

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question comes from a shareholder named Ralph Coutant (PH) who asks, “In in your press release, your original press release, you noted that Dave ‘brought the idea of purchasing Lubrizol to me on either January 14th or 15th.’

“Initially you said, ‘I was unimpressed.’ You went on to note that on January 24th you sent another note to Dave indicating your, quote, ‘skepticism’ about making an offer for the company.

“However, in a very short period of time after Dave’s discussion with Lubrizol’s CEO, you, quote, ‘quickly warmed’ to the idea.

“Please clarify what caused you to, quote, ‘warm’ to the idea so quickly if this didn’t strike you as being a great business at first glance. What changed? And what was David Sokol’s role in convincing you?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, the — it wasn’t that it didn’t — it struck me as a business I didn’t know anything about, initially.

You know, you’re talking about petroleum additives. I never would understand the chemistry of it, but I — but that’s not necessarily vital.

What is important is that I understand the economic dynamics of the industry. Is there — are there competitive moats? Is there ease of entry? All of that sort of thing. I did not have any understanding of that at all, initially.

As a matter of fact, I suggested to Dave, I said, “Charlie is a lot smarter about oil than I am. Why don’t you give him a call because I don’t — you know, I just don’t know anything about that business?”

And I talked to Charlie a few days later, and I don’t remember whether I asked him whether Dave had called or anything, but I mentioned it to Charlie, and Charlie says, “I don’t understand it, either.”

So when I talked to Dave later he had not talked — he had not gotten ahold of Charlie. I told him, “Forget it. He’s as bad as I am.”

What Dave passed along to me after having that dinner with James Hambrick, and which I later confirmed in a lunch when James Hambrick came out here on February 8th, but it was the same thing.

I thought I — and I still feel — I thought I got a good understanding of industry dynamics and how the business had developed over time, what the role of oil companies was and would be, in relation to a chemical additive.

The oil companies are the biggest customers. They sell base oil to a Lubrizol, but they buy the — they are the big customers, and they have gotten out of the business to quite a degree, although there’s two of them left in it.

So this industry had consolidated over time. I looked at the question of ease of entry. You know, every time I look at a business — when we bought See’s Candy in 1972, I said to myself, if I had a hundred million dollars and I wanted to go in and take on See’s Candy, could I do it?

And I came to the conclusion, no, so we bought See’s Candy. If the answer had been yes, we wouldn’t have done it.

I asked myself that same question, you know, can I start a soft drink company and take on Coca-Cola if I have a hundred billion dollars, you know?

Richard Branson tried it some years ago in something called Virgin Cola. You know, the brand is supposed to be a promise. I’m not sure that’s the promise you want to get if you buy a soft drink but — laughter) — in any event, I felt after my conversation with Dave, subject to a second conversation with James Hambrick, but covering the same ground, that it’s not impossible at all for people to enter this business.

But in terms of the service that — and the relatively low cost of what Lubrizol brings to the party, and in terms of people trying to break into a market and take them on — and it’s not a huge market, it’s probably only about a $10 billion market overall, I decided that there was a pretty good-sized moat around this.

They’ve got lots and lots of patents, but more than that, they have a connection with customers. They work with customers when new engines come along to develop the right kind of additive.

So I felt that I had an understanding — didn’t understand one thing more about chemistry than when I started — but I felt that I had an understanding of the economics of the business, the same way I felt that when the ISCAR people talked to me — I mean, who would think you can take some tungsten out of the ground in China and put it in the little carbide tools and that you could have some durable competitive advantage? But I decided ISCAR had a durable competitive advantage after looking at it for a while.

That’s the conclusion — I have come to the conclusion that — and Charlie as well — that the Lubrizol position is the dominant — or the number one company, not dominant — but the number one company, in terms of market share, in that business — is sustainable and that it’s a very good business over time.

It helps — you know, they are helping engines run longer, run smoother, you know. You know, when metal is acting on metal, the lubricants are important, and they’re always going to be around. And I think Lubrizol will be the leading company for a very, very long time.

And that’s the conclusion I came to. And I did not have a fix on that, nor did Charlie, prior to Dave relaying on to me what he had learned at that dinner, which incidentally, Lubrizol had been telling the world — I mean they made investor presentations and all that quite extensively over the years.

I simply hadn’t paid any real attention to it. And when it was explained to me, I thought I understood it, and I still think I understand it.

I think Lubrizol will be a very, very good addition to Berkshire. And I saw James Hambrick just yesterday, and despite the turmoil around this, they are very enthused about becoming part of Berkshire, that they regard it as the ideal home.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, you know, ISCAR and Lubrizol, to some extent, are sisters under the skin.

You’ve got very small markets that aren’t really too attractive to anybody with any sense to enter, and fanaticism in service. So if you have any more like that why, please give Warren a call. (Laughter)

11. Using Berkshire’s stock for acquisitions

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Area 3.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is Hsiang Hsiao Chu (PH) from Ottawa, Ontario. Warren, Charlie, I admire you guys tremendously.

I want to ask a question about the valuation of your company. You said, “Price is what you pay and value is what you get.”

In your letter to the shareholders this year, each Class A share owns about — investment about $95,000, and each share commands an earnings of $6,000.

So in my simplistic way of calculation, each share is worth $95,000 of investment plus the earnings discounted at 7 percent. That’s another about $90,000. So it adds up to about 185,000. Is that correct?

Does that mean the complexity of your empire is a value trap?

WARREN BUFFETT: We give those figures because we think they’re important, both the investments per share and the operating earnings per share, excluding earnings that come from the investments, and leaving out insurance underwriting profits or losses, because we think at worst they’ll break even, but they do bounce around from year to year.

Those figures are pretax on the operating earnings, so I’m not sure whether you’re applying your discount factor to pretax or after-tax.

But we think they’re important. And I would expect — well, the operating earnings, you know, are almost certain to increase. How much, you know, who knows? But that number is likely to go up.

The investments are still about the same as at year-end but that — they could go up or down based on whether we’re able to buy more operating businesses.

Our goal is to build both numbers to some extent, but our primary goal is to build the operating earnings figures.

We never — we — if Charlie and I had to stick a number in an envelope in front of us as to what we thought the intrinsic value of Berkshire was, well, neither one of us would stick a figure, we’d stick a range, because it would be ridiculous to come up with a single specific number, which encompasses not only the businesses we own, but what we’re going to do with the capital in the future.

But even our ranges would differ modestly, and they might differ tomorrow, in terms of how I would feel versus today, but not dramatically at all.

I would say this: I think — I certainly — well, you’ve received signals once or twice when we said we would buy in our stock, we obviously thought that it was selling below the bottom of a conservative range of intrinsic value, and we did that once some years ago.

And by saying so, of course, the stock went up, and so we never got any stock bought. So there’s sort of a self-defeating factor about taking the kind of approach to it that we do, in terms of really telling people that the only reason we’ll buy in stock is because we think it’s cheap. That is not standard practice in corporate America at all.

In fact, corporate America, to some extent, buys in their stock more aggressively when it’s high than when it’s low. But they may have some equation in their mind that escapes my reasoning power.

But the — I would — we do not regard Berkshire as overpriced. And I would say that we had, very recently, we had a very, very large international company that might well have been interested in doing something with Berkshire, and it’s a very nice company, but it’s bigger than we can handle unless we would use a lot of stock.

And we won’t use the stock. We just think our shareholders would come out behind. It would be a wonderful company and, you know, make a lot of headlines, but in the end our shareholders would be poorer because our stock is a currency, and unless it’s fully valued, it’s a big mistake to use it as a currency.

Now, we used some in the Burlington deal, but we used a whole lot more cash, and, in effect, we only used 30 percent for stock, and it was worth doing, but it was painful.

And if Lubrizol had wanted to do a deal involving stock, we would not have done it. I told James Hambrick that right off the bat.

So we had absolutely no interest in buying Lubrizol — we were perfectly willing to give, you know, close to $9 billion in cash, and in my view, we’re getting our money’s worth.

But we would not have given a significant portion of it in Berkshire stock, because we would be giving away part of the businesses we already own, and we like Burlington, and we like See’s Candy. We like ISCAR.

And to give away a portion of those, even to get another very good business, would not make financial sense for our shareholders.

So you can draw your own deductions about our calculations of intrinsic value from that statement.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, he’s obviously looking at two right factors. And I think that we have not permanently lost the ability to do some interesting things eventually with our enormous wealth in cash and marketable securities.

We won’t always be as inactive as we are now.

WARREN BUFFETT: We’re not that inactive, Charlie. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I don’t know. You practically crawl out of your skin, sometimes.

WARREN BUFFETT: Nine billion is — you know, we say normal earning power is 12 billion. That uses up a good portion of one year’s quota.

Although we’d like to use more. I mean, there’s no question.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Now you’re talking.

WARREN BUFFETT: Can you see us using stock in the next few years?

CHARLIE MUNGER: If the business were good enough, of course.

Our trouble is — it’s a terrible trouble you people have — the businesses you already own are so good it’s not wise to part with them to get a business we don’t own. Ordinarily.

12. Buffett is always optimistic about American capitalism

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: This is for Warren — and Charlie, too — from your longtime Omaha friend Dick Holland.

“Whenever you talk in a general way about America’s economic future, your remarks are invariably positive, even glowing, despite the severe problems of growing public and private debt, the huge budget imbalances that result, and no real policies to solve these problems.

“Some experts believe that we may reach the point where future bond offerings to cover the rising debt might fail. Many wonder if we are not entering a time of national decline.

“How can a lousy long-term U.S. economy make you so happy, and why do you see gold nuggets where others see salt?”

WARREN BUFFETT: That’s from Charlie’s good friend as well, Dick Holland, who we both have known for 60-plus years.

I don’t see how anybody can be other than enthused about this country.

If you look back to 1776 or 1789, whichever one you want to date it from, you know, it has been the most extraordinary economic period in the history of the world.

In fact, if you go back — I was born on August 30th, 1930.

Now, if somebody had come to me in the womb and said, “Let me tell you what it’s like outside now. The stock market has just crashed, but you haven’t seen anything yet. 4,000 banks are going to fail.

“The Dow Jones average is going to go down to 42. It was 381 back just a little bit before you were conceived, and it’s going to go to 42. They’re going to close the banks for a while. We’re going to have 25 percent unemployment. We’re going to have the dust bowl in the Midwest. The grasshoppers are going to take over.”

You know, it would be like in that Woody Allen movie where he says, “Go back, go back.”

All that’s happened since August 30th, 1930, is that the standard of living of the average American has increased six-for-one. Six-for-one.

You know, that’s absolutely incredible. I mean, you look at centuries where nothing happened for the average person. I mean, century after century. So we have a system that works magnificently.

It gets gummed up periodically. And it always has troubles. I mean, you know, I — my father was very anti-New Deal, so my sisters and I sat around a dinner table from the first we can remember hearing how things were going to go to hell.

As a matter of fact, my father-in-law told my wife-to-be and her mother that he wanted to have a talk with me before we got married.

And he was very much on my side, so I was not in a panic about this or anything, but I went down to his house shortly before the marriage and this wonderful man, Doc Thompson, sat in a chair for a couple of hours, and he said, “Warren,” he said. “I just want to tell you that you’re going to fail but it’s not your fault.” (Laughter)

And he said, “You and Susie, my daughter, if you starve, she would have starved anyway. I mean, it is not your fault. It’s because — you know, it’s because the Democrats are in, you know, and they’re going to take the country down the road to Communism and, you know, and just don’t worry about the fact you’re going to fail.”

And this went on for quite a while. And then he blessed me and we got married. It was a happy ending.

But ever since — when I got out of school in 1951, the two people I admired the most in the world, my dad and Ben Graham, both said, you know, you’ve got a good future but don’t start in stocks now because there’s never been a year when the Dow Jones average has not ended up below 200, and it’s above 200 now. It’s much too high, and if you start now selling stocks to people they’re going to have bad experiences. So why don’t you wait a while and go work in the Omaha National Bank or do something, park yourself on the sidelines.

There’s always negatives. The country always faces problems. I mean, this country went through, you know, it went through a civil war, you know. It — it’s gone through all kinds of things. But what happens?

You know, we have a few lousy years from time to time. We’ve had, probably, 15 recessions since the country started. And we will always have a list of 10 or 15 things at the start of the year that will tell you why this country can’t possibly work well.

But all I can tell you is that it doesn’t do it in a straight line, but the power of capitalism is incredible. I mean, you know, that’s what is bringing us out of this recession.

I mean, monetary and fiscal policy add some utility, and certainly in the fall of 2008 the government was needed in a huge, huge way. It could do what — it was the only one that could do what was needed.

But if you look at the history of the United States, you know, probably half of our recessions have occurred during — we’ll say in the 19th century — when people didn’t even know what fiscal or monetary policy was.

I mean, what happened was that excesses would come in and then the resuscitative power of capitalism would set the country back on the right — on a stronger growth pattern — and that’s happened time after time after time.

And the game isn’t over. I mean, it is not like the potential of America has been used up.

What has happened is the rest of the world has caught on, to some extent, so you’re seeing some state capitalism in places like China, and they are turning economies loose that have been dormant for centuries.

But it’s not because the people are smarter. It’s not because they work harder. It’s just because they have tapped into a system that works marvelously over time.

And I will tell you, in the next hundred years you’re going to have probably 15, maybe as many as 20 lousy years, but we will be so far ahead of where we are now that it will be unrecognizable.

Charlie? (Applause)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I can go back a lot farther than that. You know, Europe survived the Black Death, where about a third of the people died. The world is going to go on.

WARREN BUFFETT: That’s wildly optimistic for Charlie. (Laughter)

Have you got anything more encouraging than that to say, Charlie? (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: I don’t know. I kind of — I understand a little bit of Dick Holland’s point of view.

And by the way, I’ve known him a long time. He aced me out of any hope of being the chief candle snuffer at the Unitarian church. (Laughter)

He was so damn good at it. (Laughter)

Anyway, what was the question? (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Can you bring yourself to say anything optimistic?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I have a little bit of a twist on that. And so I would say that you can be cheerful even if things are slightly deteriorating, and that’s a very good quality to have.

I have a personal saying that has always amused me. I say, the politicians are never so bad you don’t live to want them back. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, on that note of wisdom — (Laughter)

13. Best assets in an inflationary environment

WARREN BUFFETT: Let’s go to area 4.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good morning. Angie Janssen (PH) of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

My question is, aside from the need to put huge amounts of capital to work, do you still believe that a high return on tangible capital business, like See’s or Coke, is the best asset to hold in an inflationary environment, or do you now think an irreplaceable hard asset with pricing power, like a railroad or a hydroelectric dam, is superior?

WARREN BUFFETT: The first group is superior. I mean, if you can have a wonderful consumer product — doesn’t have to be a consumer product — a product that requires very little capital to grow, and to do more dollar volume, as will happen with inflation even if you don’t have unit growth, and it doesn’t take much capital to support that growth, that is a wonderful asset to have in inflation.

I mean, the ultimate test of that is your own earning ability. I mean, if you’re an outstanding doctor, lawyer, whatever it may be, teacher, the — you — as inflation goes along, your services will command more and more in dollar terms, and you don’t have to make any additional investment in yourself.

People think of that, you know, with a very long-lived real estate asset or something of the sort, or a farm, or anything where additional capital is not required to finance inflationary growth.

The worst kind of businesses are the businesses with tons of receivables and inventories and all of that.

And in dollar terms, if their volume stays flat but the price level doubles, and they need to come up with double the amount of money to do that same volume of business, that can be a very bad asset.

Now normally, we are not enthused about businesses that require heavy capital investment, just like utilities and the railroad.

We think that, on the other hand, particularly with the railroad, that where you do not have any guaranteed lower rate of return, that you should be entitled to earn returns on assets that are becoming more and more valuable to the economy as — whether it’s because of inflationary factors or because of just natural growth factors, or in the case of the United States, I think it will be both.

But the ideal business — See’s Candy is doing — it was doing $25 million of volume when we bought it, and it sold 16 million pounds of candy — a little more than — well, it retails $1.90, and we had some quantity discounts, so we were doing close to $30 million worth of business.

Now, we’re doing well over $300 million worth of business. It took $9 million of tangible assets to run it when it was doing 30, and it takes about 40 million of tangible assets at 300-and-some.

So we’ve only had to ploy back $30 million into a business which will make us — well, it’s made us, probably, a billion-and-a-half pretax during that period.

And if the price of candy doubles, we don’t have any receivables to speak of. Our inventory turns fast. We don’t store it or anything like that. We gear up seasonally and the fixed assets aren’t big, so that is a much better business to own than a utility business if you’re going to have a lot of inflation.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: And what’s interesting about it is that we didn’t always know this. And so — (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: And sometimes we forget it. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s true, too.

But it shows how continuous learning is absolutely required to have any significant achievement at all in the world.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, and it does show — you know, I’ve said in the past that I’m a better businessman because I’m an investor and I’m a better investor because I’m a businessman.

There’s nothing like actually experiencing the necessity, particularly in the 1970s when inflation was gathering strength, and early ’80s, you would see this absolutely required capital investment on a very big scale that really wasn’t producing anything commensurate in the way of earnings.

I wrote an article for Fortune called “How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor” back in 1977.

You really want — the ideal asset, you know, is a royalty on somebody else’s sales during inflation, where all you do is get a royalty check every month, and it’s based on their sales volume.

And you made — you came up with some product originally, licensed it to them, and you never have another bit of capital investment. You have no receivables, you have no inventory, and you have no fixed assets.

That kind of business is real inflation protection, assuming the product maintains its viability.

So even though we are going into some very capital-intensive businesses, part of that reflects the fact we can’t deploy the amount of capital we have in a whole bunch of See’s Candies. We just can’t find them. We would love to find them, but we can’t find them in that quantity.

So we are not doing as well with capital when we have to invest many billions a year, as we would if we were investing a few millions a year. There’s no question.

That’s true in investments. It’s true in operating businesses. There is a real disadvantage to size, and we just hope that problem grows.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Now you’re talking.

14. No dividend, so sell a slice of Berkshire if you need cash

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: Aside from questions about Dave Sokol, the questions I’ve received most from shareholders have to do with dividends.

And Dave Corneal (PH), who is a shareholder who couldn’t be here this weekend because he’s at his daughter’s wedding, writes in, “I know that Berkshire is a great allocator of capital, but as an owner of stock and as I get closer to retirement, there will be a time when I will need income from my assets.

“Currently Berkshire does not pay dividends, yet it loves collecting on dividends on its investments. It also generates extensive cash flow in which it could pay dividends if it chooses to.

“Currently the only real option to get income from your Berkshire investment is to sell a share or two of the stock. Is there a point in the future where Berkshire shareholders may expect a dividend payment, or what conditions would be needed for Berkshire to consider paying a dividend?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we will pay dividend — as a matter of fact, there may be an argument that when we pay dividends we should pay out almost 100 percent, because it does mean that we lost the ability to find ways to invest a dollar in a manner that creates more than a dollar of present value for the shareholders.

But let’s assume you had a savings account, and the savings account paid 5 percent. And you had your choice of taking $50 a year out, or letting the $50 stay in and somebody would pay you 120 percent of that savings account any time you wanted to sell a piece of it.

Now, would you want to take the $5 out or would you rather let it accumulate and have the ability to sell at 120 cents on the dollar, that account?

Every dollar that’s been reinvested in Berkshire has created more than a dollar of market value, so it’s much more intelligent, if you control the dividend policy of Berkshire, it’s much more intelligent for people to leave the dollar in, have it valued at $1.20 or $1.30 or whatever it may be valued, and then sell off a little piece if they want the income, or if they want to receive some cash.

And the logic of it, I think, is unquestionable. The execution of it is a problem. I mean, the question of whether we can keep investing dollars to create more than a dollar of present market value, you know, there’s an end to that at some point.

But so far, people, by leaving 160 billion at the end of third quarter in the business, have $200 billion that they can cash out for at any time they wish.

There will come a time and, you know, who knows how soon, because the numbers are getting big — there will come a time when we do not think we can lay out, you know, 15 or 20 billion a year and get something that’s immediately worth more than that for our shareholders.

And like I say, when the time comes where a dollar is only buying us 90 cents of value, we’ll quit spending the dollar. We’ll give it to the shareholders.

But I predict that the day that Berkshire declares a dividend, the stock will go down. I mean, it will — and it should go down — because it’s an admission, essentially, that a compounding machine has lost its ability to continue on that course.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, and there’s nothing wrong with selling a little Berkshire stock to buy jewelry if you do it in the right place. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: I would like to announce that my niece, Cynthia, visited Borsheims yesterday around — I guess around 3:00 — and she was there with her boyfriend, and he proposed, and they bought a ring. Congratulations. (Applause)

Her mother did the same thing a few years ago. And, you know, these things become family traditions, so go out there and who knows what will happen? (Laughter)

15. Still bullish on bank stocks Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp

WAREEN BUFFETT: OK. Number 5.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Jeremy Pozen (PH), Newton, Massachusetts.

Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, Berkshire Hathaway has had large investments in Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank.

What are the revenue outlooks and business prospects for these two banks, given the backdrop of slow U.S. growth, an extended U.S. consumer, a tepid rebound in the U.S. housing market with foreclosures and write-downs lessening but still at historically high levels, and the potential for greater-than-expected inflation, or worse, possibly, deflation similar to Japan?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp are both among the best large banks, if not the best, in the country and they’re different than what you think of in terms of some money center banks, but they’re very large. Wells is four times as large as USB.

Banking as a whole — U.S. banking — profitability will be considerably less, in my view, in the period ahead than it was, say, in the early part of this century.

And a very important reason is that the leverage will be reduced. And that’s probably a good thing for society.

It’s — it may be a bad thing for individual banks that could use leverage intelligently, but the trouble was that they all thought they could use leverage intelligently, and the actions of one, or more, that were unintelligent about it, you know, had consequences for everybody, which you can see if you view HBO on whatever it is — is it May 26?

The — so I would say that return on assets — even if return on assets were as good as it was some years ago, there will be less assets per dollar of common equity than before which means returns on common equity will be less.

We still think that Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank are very good operations. We think they’re very decent businesses. They’re not as attractive as when leverage ratios could be higher.

In terms of the troubles in banking, I think you’ve seen, by far, the worst in the past. And loan losses have been trending downward now for several quarters, and I think the expectation is that will continue, and I think banking is a very fundamental business.

But as John Stumpf said a few years ago at Wells Fargo, he said, “I don’t know why we keep thinking of new ways to lose money when the old ones were working so well.” (Laughter)

And banks periodically go crazy. It’s always on the asset side.

I mean, here you’ve got cheap money. You’ve got the federal government behind, although the federal government has never had to pay out anything on — in terms of the FDIC.

The FDIC has handled 3800 since it was established on January 1, 1934. The FDIC has paid out probably 3800, 3900 by now, institutions, 250 of them or so in the last couple years. And that has not cost the U.S. taxpayer a penny. I mean, that has all come from FDIC assessments on other banks. It’s been a mutual insurance company.

Banking, if you just keep out of trouble on the asset side, is a very good business because you get your money so cheap and, you know, because of the implicit federal guarantee, and you do get to leverage up to a fair extent, and America’s been a pretty good place to lend money.

So I like our positions in there. You will see that — if you looked at those totals — you’ll see we’ve added to Wells Fargo. And both those companies are very well run institutions, but they will not be able to earn — I don’t know what the figures were, but I think they were up 25 or — to 30 percent on tangible equity — and that’s not going to get repeated in the future, and it shouldn’t be.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, yeah, we might add that M&T Bank, which most people —

WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, yeah.

CHARLIE MUNGER: — never talk about, is headed by a really sensible fellow, and it’s been a wonderful investment for us.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, as a matter of fact, if you get the M&T annual report, it’s written by Bob Wilmers, the letter, the first part of it is about M & T specifically, but the second part is about particularly the American financial economy, and I would really recommend you read that.

Bob is a very smart guy and he has a lot of good observations.

And, frankly, the other one I recommend you read is Jamie Dimon’s letter, at JPMorgan, is a tour de force, in terms of describing the banking scene, the economic scene. He has some real insights in there about some very important subjects.

We don’t own that stock, but it’s a letter that I think everybody could learn a lot from reading, as they could from reading Bob Wilmer’s letter at M&T.

CHARLIE MUNGER: And those people who like an element of morality in business, Wilmer sounds like an Old Testament prophet.

I mean, he really doesn’t like it that all the really big banks are making so much money out of trading, because he says you’re really trying to outsmart your own customers, and he’d rather serve them in a culture of deserved trust in both directions. It’s hard to think he’s totally wrong.

WARREN BUFFETT: He also expresses quite a dislike for the fact that a market system creates a reward system where money sort of disproportionally flows to people who work with money, and that that tends to attract a disproportional number of people that — of lots of ability that he thinks might be — at least some of them — might be better deployed elsewhere. It’s an interesting read.

CHARLIE MUNGER: It’s one of the best annual reports that’s ever came out of banking. Right out of Buffalo.

16. Productive assets will always beat gold

WARREN BUFFETT: Ok. Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question who comes from Neil Steinhoff (PH) who writes, “The commodity market, and particularly gold, have appreciated astronomically over the last few years.

“My Berkshire Hathaway stock is only slightly better — doing better — than it was in 2006. It’s barely kept up with inflation,” he says.

“Please explain why you have not invested more heavily in commodities. As long as Ben Bernanke continues to print money and there’s no indication he’s going to stop any time soon, isn’t it right that commodities, and particularly gold, will continue to appreciate?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I would point out that when we started with Berkshire, it was about 3/4 of an ounce of gold, and gold was $20 an ounce then, and it was 15.

So gold, even at 1500, has a ways to go, and the — (Laughter and applause)

I think he’s right about inflation. But if you think about it, there are three major categories of investment. And you ought to think very hard about which category you want to be in before you start thinking about the choices available within that category.

Now, the first category is anything denominated in a currency. It could be bonds, it could be deposits in a bank, it can be a money market fund, it can be cash in your pocket.

And the — if you will reach in your pocket — I don’t like to do this, but — and pull out your wallet — you’re watching an historic event. (Laughter)

If you look at this — and I might point out this is a one. Charlie carries a — on the back of it, it says, “In God We Trust.” And that’s really false advertising.

The — if Elizabeth Warren were here, she would say, quite properly, it should say, “In Government We Trust,” because God isn’t going to do anything about that dollar bill, you know, if government does the wrong things, in terms of keeping it as valuable as it was when you parted with it to buy a bond or put it in a bank.

Any currency-related investment is a bet on how government now, and in the future, will behave. And if you happen to be unfortunate to live — fortunate to live in Zimbabwe and you decided to make currency-related investments, you know, you — family would have left you by now, and it was not a good decision.

Almost all currencies have declined in value over time. I mean, it may be built into almost any economic system that it will be easier to work with a value of currency that declines in value than a currency that appreciates in value, and the Japanese might reaffirm that here with their experience.

So as a class, currency-related investments, whether they are in the UK, or the United States, or anyplace else, unless we’re getting paid extremely well for having them, we do not think make much sense.

The second category of investments regard items that you buy that don’t produce anything but that you hope someone will pay you more for later on. And the classic case of that is gold.

And I’ve used this illustration before, but if you take all of the gold in the world — don’t get too excited now — and put it into a cube, it will be a cube that’s about 67 feet on a side. That would be 165,000 or 170,000 metric tons.

So you could have a cube — if you owned all the gold in the world — you could have a cube that would be 67 or 68 feet on a side, and you could get a ladder and you could climb up on top of it, and you could say, you know I’m sitting on top of the world, and think you’re king of the world.

You could, you know, you could fondle it, you could polish it, you could do all these things with it. Stare at it. But it isn’t going to do anything.

All you are doing when you buy that is that you’re hoping that somebody else a year from now, or five years from now, will pay you more to own something that, again, can’t do anything, but you’re hoping that the person then thinks that somebody else will buy something five years later from him.

In other words, you’re betting on not just how scared people are now of paper money, you’re betting on how much they think a year from now people will be scared two years from then on.

Keynes described all of this. I think it was in Chapter 12 of “The General Theory,” when he talked about this famous beauty contest where the game was not to pick out the most beautiful woman among the group, but the one that other people would think was the most beautiful woman, and then he carried it on to second and third degrees of reasoning.

Any time you buy an asset that can’t do anything, produce anything, you’re simply betting on whether somebody else will pay more for, again, an asset that can’t do anything.

And actually, we did that with silver, but silver had an industrial use, and we — about 13 years ago I bought a whole lot of silver. And if you’ll notice, silver has moved recently, so my timing was only about 13 years off, but, you know, who’s perfect?

The third category of asset is something that you value based on its — what it will produce, what it will deliver. You buy a farm because you expect a certain amount of corn or soybeans or cotton or whatever it may be, to come your way every year. And you decide how much you pay based on how much you think the asset itself will deliver over time. And those are the assets that appeal to me and Charlie.

Now, there’s some logical follow-on to that. If you buy that farm, and you really think about how many bushels of corn, how much bushels of soybeans will it produce, how much do I have to pay the tenant farmer, how much do I have to pay in taxes and so on, you can make a rational calculation, and the success of that investment will be determined in your own mind by whether it meets your expectations as to what it delivers.

Logically, you should not care whether you get a quote on that farm a day later, or a week later, or a month later, or a year later. We feel the same way about businesses.

When we buy ISCAR, or we buy Lubrizol, or whatever, we don’t run around getting a quote on it every week and say, you know, “Is it up or down or anything like that?” We look to the business.

We feel the same way about securities. When we buy a marketable security, we don’t care if the stock exchange closes for a few years.

So when we look at Berkshire, we are looking at what we think can be delivered from the productive assets that we own, and how we can utilize that capital in acquiring more productive assets.

And there will be times, you know, cotton doubled in price, much to our chagrin at Fruit of the Loom, but, you know, if you own cotton for the right six or eight months in the past year, you came close to doubling your money.

But if you go back a century and try to make money owning cotton over time, it has not been a very good investment.

So to pick a product, crude oil, cotton, gold, silver, anything that — and, of course, cotton has utility. Gold really doesn’t have utility.

I would bet on good-producing businesses to outperform something that doesn’t do anything over any period of time.

But there’s no question that rising prices create their own excitement. So when people see gold go up a lot — I mean, if your neighbor owns some gold, and you think you’re smarter than he is, and you didn’t own any, and your wife says to you, you know, “How come that jerk next door is making money, you know, and you’re just sitting here?” It can start affecting behavior.

And people like to get in on things that have been rising in price and all of that. But over time, that has not been the way to get rich.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I certainly agree with that. And besides, something peculiar to buy an asset which only will really go up if the world really goes to hell. (Laughter)

It doesn’t strike to me as an entirely rational thing to do.

I think you can figure on leaving the country because the country is going to kill you. And all the countries you might go to will also be thoroughly screwed up.

I think all those people should buy a little gold, but I think the rest of us would be better off with Berkshire Hathaway stock. (Laughter and applause)

And, of course, there’s another class of people that think they can protect themselves by buying paintings of soup cans. (Laughter)

I don’t recommend that, either. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: One thing about gold, also, is that in addition to this 67-foot cube, more gold is being produced every year.

So you have to have buyers not only to offset sellers in the natural course of events, but you have to absorb something like a hundred billion dollars’ worth of added items of no utility.

I mean, it’s really interesting. I mean, they dig it up out of the ground in South Africa, and then they ship it to the Federal Reserve in New York and they put it back in the ground.

I mean, if you were watching this from Mars you might think it was a little peculiar. But think of how many people it makes happy.

I might mention that the value of that cube, all the gold in the world, is now about — valued at 1500-plus — it’s about $8 trillion. And there are a billion acres, roughly, of farmland in the United States. That’s a little a million-and-a-half square miles. And that’s valued at something over 2 trillion.

And if you take ten Exxon Mobils, you get up, maybe, another 4 trillion and — maybe not that much even — and so you could own all the farmland in the United States, every bit of it, and you could own ten Exxon Mobiles and you could stick a trillion or so in your pocket for walking around money, and you could have your choice of that or this 67-foot piece of gold that you could fondle and — (Laughter)

That may seem like a close choice to some people, but not to me. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, you would also need an army to defend the gold. And it’s really not a very good spot.

17. Buffett on getting his first investors

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Number 6.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: — Millard, Dallas, Texas.

Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, when you were raising your first investment funds, how did you go about attracting investors, and once you had your first funds and your first investors, how did you go about growing them?

WARREN BUFFETT: Sounds to me like a man that’s about ready to start a hedge fund. (Laughter)

The — in my case, I’d moved back here from New York in March or so of 1956, and a few members of my family said we’d like you to manage our investments just like I did when I was selling securities out here before I went to New York. And I didn’t like being in the securities selling business, partly because if I sold somebody a stock at 20 and it went down to 10, I wanted to buy more, but I couldn’t face the idea of people that had bought at 20 and, based only on confidence in me not because they understood it, and now they were feeling depressed, and it was — it just wasn’t — it wasn’t very satisfactory.

I could not do as well managing money if people were watching every decision as I could if I did it in a room all by myself.

So I just told these seven members of the family — one of them, actually, was my roommate in college and his mother, they came in also — I said, you know, if you’d like to join up in a partnership, I’m not going to tell you what’s going on, but I will tell you that I will be doing with my own money what I’m doing with yours. Later on, I put all my own money in.

And it just was very slow.

A few months later, Graham-Newman, that I’d worked for, was liquidating, and a fellow named Homer Dodge asked Ben Graham what he should do with the money he was getting out of Graham-Newman. He said, “This kid used to work for me and he’s OK.” And so he came out and went in with me.

And another fellow, late in the fall, had seen the notice of partnership formed in some legal paper and he said, “What’s this?” and came in with me. It’s just — we just stumbled along.

And for almost six years, I operated out of my house, no employee. I kept all the books, I filed the tax returns, I, you know, went out and picked up the stocks personally and stuck them in a safe deposit box.

When Charlie came along, I kept chiding him about the fact — I met him in 1959 — and I said, “Law is OK as a hobby, but it’s no place for a man with your intellect to spend his time.” (Laughter)

And, well, I’ll let Charlie take it over from there. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: It actually took me a long time to leave what was a family business.

And so any of you who are having a slow time accepting good ideas, why, you should be cheered by my example, because it was some years after you started working on me, and you pounded on me, and I slowly got the point.

WARREN BUFFETT: And he was actually asking about attracting money.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, of course, it helps if you conducted yourself in life so that other people trust you. (Laughter)

And then it helps even more if —

WARREN BUFFETT: You can see why I was so slow and he was so fast. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: And then it helps even more if other people are right to trust you. So the formula is quite simple. First one, then the other.

WARREN BUFFETT: Unfortunately, with the present fee structure, just attracting money, rather than performing with it, can be enormously lucrative.

So the skill of attracting money may be — at least in the short run, and maybe the intermediate run — it may be a more important quality than the ability to manage money.

But we, neither one of us, ever charged any fixed fee of any kind.

Am I right on that, Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, we stopped taking any significant overrides on other people’s money at very young ages and at very small amounts of net worth.

I wish our example were more common. But I like our compensation practices, too, and they’re spreading slowly.

We get a new company every, what, five years?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

18. Berkshire isn’t a ’60s “Go-Go” conglomerate

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: This is from Jeff — sorry, Jeff Cunningham of Directorship.

“Berkshire’s corporate strategy resembles that of the go-go conglomerates of the 1960s: Geneen’s ITT, Teledyne, Textron.

“Small corporate team, tight financial controls, sector neutrality, and little involvement in subsidiary operations, and ultimately not fully valued for the sum of their parts. If you disagree with this, how does Berkshire differ?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, it — we are a conglomerate and, you know, people shy from that name, but that’s exactly what we are.

And I think I laid out in the annual report at least one of the advantages of being a conglomerate, namely the tax-efficient transfer of money from businesses that do not have good ways of using it to businesses that have better ways of using it, which is, if it’s carried out intelligently, is a very significant plus.

The conglomerates you mentioned — and I’m familiar with all of them — really became sort of stock issuance machines, where the idea was to get your stock to sell at a very high multiple, and then trade it for something else that was selling at a lower multiple, and voilà, you know, earnings per share went up, and then people said you’ll do it again.

So it was — it was really accepted and endorsed by Wall Street that if you had this sort of semi-Ponzi scheme of issuing shares constantly for things that had lower P/E ratios, everybody knew what the game was, but they thought the game would continue to succeed. And for a while it did.

And the Gulf and Westerns of the world, and the Littons of the world, and there were numbers of them, it was almost like an unspoken conspiracy that nobody will point out that this is kind of a perpetual motion machine, and if they don’t it will keep working.

But if something says anything about it, somebody says, “The emperor has no clothes,” it will all collapse.

The interesting thing, of course, you mentioned Teledyne in there. Teledyne played that game, and then it ended, and all of this stuff came back to Earth, but then Teledyne went into reverse and bought in stock like crazy when their stock got underpriced.

So they issued stock like crazy when it was overpriced, and they bought it in to an extraordinary degree when it was underpriced, and it created a sensational record.

Most of those companies, though, I think have very little relationship to Berkshire.

It’s true that, I think, some of them were pretty decentralized, although I remember — didn’t Harold Geneen have some famous room that he brought everybody in —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes.

WARREN BUFFETT: —chewed them out, you know, monthly for not making their projections, so they learned to make them whether they were actually really making them or not.

The managers were — if you took Charlie Bluhdorn at Gulf and Western, or, you know, take the group, they were primarily thinking about how — Jimmy Ling at LTV — they were primarily thinking about how they could pump the stock up to a level where they could buy big established businesses that were selling at lower P/E ratios and sort of have this perpetual motion game going. And it came to an end.

I don’t think there’s — you know, at Berkshire we are not in that game. We are in the game of trying to buy very good businesses that we’re going to keep forever and having them grow their earnings and have them also throw off cash that we can use to buy more similar businesses.

It is a conglomerate. Conglomerates, generally, are unpopular, and I don’t disagree with why they are. But I think it’s a very rational way of running the business as long as you keep it focused on running businesses and not as a stock-issuance machine.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, yes, and some of those companies got into really pretty heavy manipulation of the numbers.

One of them said, “I know what I’m going to report, I just don’t know how I’m going to do it.” (Laughter)

That’s not the attitude around this place.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we don’t know what we’re going to report. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: No, no. And sometimes we don’t know how to do it, either. (Laughter)

19. Buffett’s preferred legacy: “teacher”

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Number 7.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good morning, Warren and Charlie. John Norwood from West Des Moines, Iowa.

I have a question on legacy. A hundred years from now, Warren and Charlie, what would each of you like to be remembered for?

WARREN BUFFETT: Old age. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: I’ve heard Warren say that what he wants said at his funeral is that’s the oldest looking corpse I ever saw. (Laughter)

I have a different saying that came down from one of my great grandfathers. And I think it — he wanted to be remembered for a fortune fairly won and wisely used. That’s a pretty good system.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I would — if you really ask me, I’d probably like “teacher.” I enjoy teaching a lot.

Some people think I do a little too much of the didactic stuff, but I like students coming. And, you know, I’ve benefited by some fabulous teachers, starting with my dad, but going on to Ben Graham, going on to Tom Murphy, I mean, lots of great teachers. So I would say that.

I might point out that on Wilt Chamberlain’s gravestone, I think it says, “At last, I sleep alone.” (Laughter)

Well, we have some people from Kansas here, anyway. (Laughs)

20. Dollar will decline, but inflation won’t destroy the economy

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from Pierre Sorel. He’s a portfolio manager at Fidelity and he says that the U.S. dollar has been depreciating against major currencies.

“The Federal Reserve continues to run a zero interest rate policy in contrast to other major economies that are raising rates or have stepped back from quantitative easing.

“A few years ago, Berkshire had a short U.S. dollar position to preserve the company’s value from the devaluating dollar.

“So what’s the company’s management doing about the risk of further U.S. dollar weakness, given that most of the company’s assets and operating businesses are denominated in the U.S. dollar?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we had a significance short position some years ago. Last year we had a small short position in two currencies, and we made about a hundred million dollars in them, but we have not been really active in the foreign exchange market.

We think — shouldn’t speak for Charlie here on this — but I think that there’s no question that the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar will decline over time. The only question is at what rate.

But I also think that the purchasing power of most currencies around the world — almost most currencies around the world — will decline.

And, of course, a short position is just a bet on which one declines at the faster rate, and I don’t have a strong conviction on that. I’ve got some mild feelings about it but not enough to where I want to back it up with a lot of money.

We do own some businesses — I mean, l take Coca-Cola.

Coca-Cola — I don’t have the exact figures — but my guess is that 80 percent or thereabouts of the earnings will be non-dollar. And we’ve got exposure in various other ways.

But we are not — we’re unlikely to make another big currency bet, although I — you know, I do think that the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar is destined to decrease. And I have fears, but I’ve long had some unwarranted fears, of it declining at a rapid rate.

Now, Charlie has pointed out to me that the dollar of 1930, when I was born, is worth 6 cents now. You know, 16-to-1 in terms of depreciation. And as he points out, we’ve both done pretty well.

So inflation has not destroyed us.

If somebody had said to me in 1930, In addition to this Great Depression you’re facing, and a World War where it looks like we’re even losing for a little while, and all these terrible things, on top of that that dollar that, you know, your grandfather is going to hand you when you’re born, is only going to be worth six cents in purchasing power, that might have been discouraging.

But overall, we’ve still done pretty well.

So, I hate inflation, but we’ve adapted pretty well to it over the years, and we have not had the total runaway-type inflation that really can be upsetting to a society, yet, but I think it’s something you always have to guard against.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: No, but God knows where the world is headed. I just think that one way or another, the world muddles through.

Take a really god-awful culture, which is Greece, modern Greece.

I don’t mean there’s anything wrong with the Greeks, but — in their family life — but the way they manage their money and pay their taxes. The main industry in Greece — or one of the main industries — is tourist attractions, and they closed right — most of the time — during the tourist season.

It’s a pretty dysfunctional government. (Laughter)

And, of course, people don’t want to pay any taxes or do much work, and yet there it is. It’s — the people of Greece are surviving.

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s lasted a long time.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, yeah.

Adam Smith said it very well. He said, “A great civilization has a lot of ruin in it.”

It takes a long time, and there’s a lot left after you’ve been through a good deal of ruin.

In fact, it’s an easier game than the ordinary process of living and then dying.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I think we’ll see a lot of inflation, but if I had a choice, I would rather be born in the United States today than any other place, any other time in history, so — (Applause)

21. Buy Berkshire stock or a mutual fund?

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Area 8.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good morning, Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. This is Mary Bundrick (PH) from Rochester, Minnesota.

I was wondering, what factors would you consider in deciding between investment in Berkshire Hathaway versus a no-load mutual fund?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I advise people to buy index funds, actually, if they’re not going to be active in investments.

I mean, if you just are going — if you’ve got a day job, and you want to just put money aside over time, I think the average individual will do better buying an index fund consistently over time than almost anything else available to them.

I think it will be a perfectly satisfactory investment. It won’t be — it’ll never be regarded as a great investment, but it will be a perfectly satisfactory investment.

If I personally had a choice between an index fund and Berkshire at present prices, I would rather own Berkshire. But I wouldn’t be unhappy if you told me I had to leave all my money in an index fund for the rest of my life and then — but I like Berkshire better. (Laughs)

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I like it a lot better, and I’d be very unhappy if I had to own an index fund. My ambitions are larger.

I don’t think the average return of a skilled investor over the next 50 years is going to be as good after all factors as it was over the last 50 years.

So I think reduced expectations are the best defense any investor has, and after that, I think Berkshire is a pretty good bet.

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie’s big on lowering expectations.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Absolutely. (Laughter)

That’s the way I got married. (Laughter)

My wife lowered her expectations. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: And he lived up to them. (Laughter)

22. “Rules are not meant to be danced around”

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: The question is, “Can you explain the company’s policy for your own personal investing outside of Berkshire and that of your other managers, and why aren’t all trades in investments first cleared through a compliance department like that of most other companies?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I don’t think it is true of most other companies.

We have 260,000 employees, and we have one company that’s a subsidiary of General Re called New England Asset Management, but that’s the only company that advises other people on investments or operates in the investment field.

At Berkshire, there are presently three people that can execute trades, and then there are a few other clerical people that would see what was done.

But we are not an investment advisory firm. We’re not a mutual fund or anything of the sort.

So if we — we have some, I think, pretty clear rules that are going to be looked at, again, I can assure you, by the audit committee.

But in terms of the Code of Conduct, Code of Ethics, and insider trading rules, which go to the managers, I don’t think there’s anything ambiguous in those.

Now, to extend those beyond — I don’t know, Marc, how many people those go to but — whether 60 or 70 or something, I’m not sure of the number — but the problem with rules, you know, is, I mean, you’ve got to have them and we emphasize not only the letter of them, but the spirit. That’s why I write that letter every couple years.

I was on the audit committee, for example, of Coca-Cola. And Coca-Cola has about one-fifth as many employees — or did then — had about 50,000 — had about one-fifth as many employees as Berkshire. And each time the audit committee met we had eight or 10 code violations.

I mean, people — if you take Berkshire at 260,000 people, you know, that’s about the number of households in the greater metropolitan Omaha. And perfect as we like to think we are in Omaha, I will tell you there’s a lot of things going on in Omaha right as we sit here that, you know, do not match the rules. So it’s a real problem.

The problem, obviously, with the Sokol thing is it hit very, very high up, you know.

But we had a case sometime back where a fellow that was a friend of mine, vice president of one of our subsidiaries, and, like I say, a personal friend, and we supplied the evidence that sent him to jail.

You know, it has happened. We had a — as I remember some years ago, I think it was in Woodbury, New York, we may have had a woman arrested in the offices just because we want to make very clear, you know, what — that we mean business and as the — as the audit committee said that this is not public relations, this is reality.

Here’s a letter that went out from Johns Manville. I didn’t know anything about it until Todd Raba gave it to me the other day, but it describes what — dated April 27, and it said, “The audit committee clearly found that Mr. Sokol compromised the integrity-related values of both Berkshire and JM have worked so hard to ingrain in the fabric of both companies.

“This should serve as a tragic lesson learned for every employee in JM.” And then in boldface, “There are no gray areas when it comes to integrity.” And it goes on.

So we hope to get some value out of this experience that will help us reinforce, with not only the 60 or 70 managers, but with 260,000 people that we do mean business on this, and we’ve showed them we mean business when we have sent more than one person to jail.

But there will be, you know, we can have all the records in the world and if somebody wants to trade outside them or something, you know, I — they’re not going to tell us they’re trading in their cousin’s name. I mean, you know, it just doesn’t work that way.

We will have occasions in the future when people do wrong things.

Usually they get handled at the subsidiary level. I mean, it’s somebody doing something, whether it’s getting a kickback from a vendor or stealing out of a cash register, whatever it may be, and then, you know, we get the occasional mega one, which is very painful.

But we will — if there’s anything we can do in the rules that will make it even more explicit or get across further the idea that rules are not made to be danced around but rather that the spirit of them extends beyond them, we want to be sure we do it.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, all that said, if you look at the greatest institutions in the world, they select very trustworthy people, and they trust them a lot. And it’s so much fun to be trusted. And there’s so much self-respect you get from it when you are trusted and are worthy of the trust, that I think your best compliance cultures are the ones which have this attitude of trust, and some of the ones with the biggest compliance departments, like Wall Street, have the most scandals.

So it’s not so simple that you can make your behavior better automatically just by making the compliance department bigger and bigger and bigger.

This general culture of trust is what works. And, you know, Berkshire hasn’t had that many scandals of consequence, and I don’t think we’re going to get huge numbers, either.

23. Deficit spending is economic stimulus

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Number 9. (Applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Charlie and Warren. I’m Michelle from Decatur, Illinois.

Half the U.S. economy seems to be in a sluggish recovery while most foreign economies are showing solid growth numbers.

Are there any significant changes that you think can be made to either current U.S. economic policy or Federal Reserve policy or tax laws to get the economy healthy and growing in the U.S.?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we’ve really had our foot to the floor in both monetary and fiscal policy.

You know, you’ve seen it, obviously, on the monetary side, with extended period of effectively zero interest rates and actually with the chairman, just the other day saying this is going to go on for an extended period.

And then they asked him what an extended period meant, and he was — he said an extended period. (Laughter)

The — but we — it’s hard to imagine pushing harder on monetary policy than has occurred.

The interesting thing is people think of fiscal policy and they think, well, we had a stimulus bill.

Well, if you think about what stimulus really is, it’s not whether you call something a stimulus bill. If you had something that was called a stimulus bill and you didn’t run a deficit, it would not be, you know, it would not be a stimulus. You’d be —

And if you don’t have anything you call a stimulus bill at all, but you’re spending 10 percent more of your GDP than you’re taking in, you are applying an incredible stimulus — fiscal stimulus — to the economy.

We have a huge fiscal stimulus program going on now, and it’s called taking in 15 percent of GDP and spending 25 percent of GDP. That’s extraordinary.

So, I think that we have used those levers in a way that’s almost unprecedented. And I think it’s been wise, in general, to do what’s done, and I think it was particularly wise what was done in the fall of 2008.

But I think, generally, we have followed the right policies. I think they’re less important than most people think they are.

I think if you did the wrong policies it would really screw things up. But I don’t — I don’t — I think the natural resuscitative powers of capitalism are — will be the biggest factor in taking us out.

And I think you’ve seen that over the last two years and we’re seeing it month by month.

I would say this: residential construction is flatlined at, you know, 500,000 or so units per year.

I think when it comes back, and it will, but it will take — it takes working off a crazy excess inventory we had, and there’s no way to do that except through creating fewer residential units than you create households. That’s how you reduce the oversupply.

When that ends — when part comes back — I think you’re going to see much more of a pick-up in employment than you might think just by looking at construction workers.

I mean, we have Shaw Carpets. You know, I’m sure they’re not counted as construction jobs, but we have thousands fewer people working there because residential construction is where it is.

And we have people at the Furniture Mart and how much carpet they’re selling or houses, so I think there’s a lot of indirect, as well as direct, reservoir of jobs that will be drawn upon, or utilized, when residential construction comes back.

I don’t think I’d measure it just by the number of construction workers that are being employed currently versus, say, four or five years ago.

It will come back. I don’t know when. I said in the annual report I thought you’d be seeing it by the end of the year. I may or may not be right on that, but that would be my best guess, still.

We are creating households faster than we’re creating housing units. And, you know, we lose housing units just — you know, you look at the — with the tornadoes recently.

So there are — that problem will get cured. And I don’t think, when you mention we’re progressing more slowly than other places, certainly in terms of Asia, you know, there’s no question about it, or Brazil, but actually, I think our pace of coming out of this, while it’s been slow compared to the hit we took in 2008 — the American economy was paralyzed — it’s come back quite a distance, and we see that in our businesses.

Now, you know, our peak on railcar loadings were 219,000 one week, I believe, in 2006, but — and our bottom was 150- or 51-thousand. We’ll probably run 190,000, or thereabouts, currently, and that will pick up more as the year goes along.

So it’s come back a significant way. We have certain companies that are setting records that serve basic industries. If you look at TTI, which makes — which distributes — electronic components, has thousands and thousands of customers all over the world — it’s setting new records, and it’s way up in the first quarter and it set a record last year.

If you look at ISCAR, which supplies nothing but basic industry, I mean, nobody buys little carbon cutting tools, you know, to put in their recreation room or anything. This stuff is used, you know, for making big things, and their business is going up and up and up, you know, month by month.

So, the economy is coming back, and when residential construction finally gets this huge overhang largely eliminated I think — I think you’ll see a lot of improvement in the employment picture.

Charlie?

24. Munger tells how he’d take “an ax to our financial sector”

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, the one place that I feel we’re making a huge mistake is not learning enough from the big mess that came from wretched excess in our financial system.

I don’t think we throttled the sin and folly out of that aspect of the economy nearly enough. And I think — if you look at all the panics and depressions in the United States, they all came from financial collapses, usually preceded by perfectly asinine and greedy behavior. And I think that would be a lot to be said for taking an ax to our financial sector and whittling it down to a more constructive size.

WARREN BUFFETT: Tell us more about how you use that ax. (Applause)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, Warren, I’ll make myself ridiculous, but I guess I’m so old I’m entitled to do that.

The — I would have the tax system discourage trading. I would have various kinds of Tobin taxes.

I would have securities trading more with the frequency of real estate than the trading by computer algorithms where one person’s computers outwit another person’s computers in what amounts to sort of legalized front running.

I don’t think we need any of that stuff. And I think making heroes out of the people who succeed at it is not good for the fiber of the country, either.

I hate the idea that 25 percent of our best engineers are going into the financial sector.

So, I think it’s crazy what we’ve allowed. (Applause)

And I think the lack of contrition in our financial sector, after the disgraceful stuff they got us into, is perfectly awesome. It makes Dave Sokol look like a hero. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: He’s getting warmed up. (Laughter)

Just as a sidelight, how many of you know that if you trade an S & P future contract — 500 — S&P 500 contract — and you hold it for 10 seconds and you have a profit, that 60 percent of the gain is long-term gain and 40 percent is short-term gain. So, essentially, our Congress has said that this activity should be more lightly taxed, you know, than cleaning washrooms or doing all the things that you people do every day. You get a special tax treatment.

Now that illustrates one of the problems with the tax code, in that there’s a few people that care intensely about having that in there, and the cost of it, in terms of less revenue for the U.S. government, is diffused among a large group, none of whom have enough interest to want to go out and write their Congressman or hire a lobbyist to fight the other way.

But it’s pretty extraordinary that we have decided that that particular form of activity should get 60 percent taxed at a 15 percent maximum rate, even though it may only take 10 or 20 seconds and be just a little flicker on a screen.

CHARLIE MUNGER: And the hedge fund operators of America get a much lower tax rate than the professors of physics or the drivers of taxis. This is demented. (Applause)

25. Update on Buffett’s bet against hedge funds

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, with that, we’re getting to our break at noon, and I promised — I made a bet three years ago with some fellows that run a fund of funds, and I promised to put the figures up every year as to how we’re doing.

It’s a 10-year deal, and if we can put up the slide — what number would that be? Probably five.

As you can see, these funds of funds — these are five funds of funds groups chosen by these people who I like, Ted Seides and his friends, and Ted couldn’t be with us today, but we will put these figures up annually.

He got off to a very good start with his group. Obviously, hedge funds should do better in a down market. And we haven’t caught them yet with the S&P 500, but it will give you all a reason to keep coming back over the next seven years as I report regularly on how we are doing in the S&P 500 versus the five funds of funds.

As [Fortune Magazine’s] Carol [Loomis] pointed out in an article recently or a — maybe it was on the web — in reporting on this, she looked at the bottom line where the investors in the S&P 500 are behind for the three years, and the investors in the funds of funds are behind, and the only people that are ahead so far are the investment managers. (Laughs)

They’re doing very well at this point. So we’ll keep you up to date on that.

Afternoon session

1. Two clarifications on David Sokol and Lubrizol

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. If you’ll all be seated.

I can’t see whether Ron Olson is in the front row or not.

Ron, are you here?

OK. Ron wanted to — well, we’ll get you a mic.

Because we’re transcribing this and we want to get it all corrected, Ron has one point or two points that he wants to correct in terms of dates that I used. So we are going to give the microphone to him.

RON OLSON: Not that they’re all that telling, but I thought since we are creating a record, I wanted to clarify two points.

The Berkshire law firm, namely Munger, Tolles & Olson worked with the Lubrizol counsel in pulling together what Warren described as Lubrizol’s proxy describing the background of the transaction.

We, as counsel for Berkshire, started to work on that gathering of facts pertaining to Berkshire’s involvement, essentially David Sokol’s and Warren’s, during the week of March 15.

Warren, in speaking to you about the facts this morning, I believe, placed the beginning of that work in the subsequent week. So I simply wanted to clarify that as we gathered the facts, and that gathering included several interviews of David Sokol during that week.

Secondly, in describing internal policies at Berkshire to protect against misbehavior or negligent behavior, Berkshire maintains a — something that those in the trading business describe as restricted lists.

And on that restricted list are any securities in which Berkshire is buying, selling, has a peculiar interest, and that prohibits any of the corporate officers or the top officers of the subsidiaries of Berkshire from participating in trades in those securities without the consent of the CFO, Marc Hamburg.

That is what I wanted to clarify, Warren.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thanks, Ron.

2. Munger still bullish on electric-car maker BYD

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. We’ll move right along. And we’re going to go to 3:30 and then we’ll adjourn for a couple minutes, and then we’ll go to the regular meeting.

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol again leads off.

CAROL LOOMIS: Warren and Charlie, both of your expressed a very positive view of BYD and its chairman, Wang Chuanfu, when MidAmerican bought its stake in 2008.

Does BYD remain as attractive a long-term investment now as it was when you acquired your stake?

If so, why? Has BYD’s recent pattern of unexplained product launch delays affected your confidence in the operation?

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie is the BYD expert, so I’m going to let him start on that one.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, of course, the price is still way higher than the price Berkshire paid, and so almost by definition it’s not quite as cheap as it was then.

Any company that tries to move as fast as BYD does, and on as many fronts, is going to have various delays and glitches. But I would say I’m quite encouraged by what’s going on, and I expect delays and glitches.

They had trouble in the auto distribution, but they tried to double auto sales every year for six years, and it worked the first five times. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: I have nothing to add. (Laughter)

3. Making money by trading oil is too hard

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Number 10.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Warren and Charlie. My name is Catherine Brood (PH). I’m from Los Angeles, California.

I invest primarily in commodities and commodity equities. I started out back 2007 buying oil.

In the summer of 2008, we reached the peak of the oil bubble. That’s when I reversed my holdings and started shorting oil.

I made a nice profit.

In 2009, I started buying oil again and oil equities, and I’ve been doing pretty well. But given the status of the world today and the price of oil, I’m questioning my investments.

Is this another oil bubble? Has oil reached its peak? Should I keep my holdings? Should I short oil? Should I exit oil altogether and move into other commodities or other investments?

So my question to you is, what your sentiments regarding oil?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I would say you’ve done a whole lot better than we have. (Laughs)

I think the crowd would rather hear from you.

We actually did take a position in oil — I don’t know how many years ago.

CHARLIE MUNGER: A long time ago.

WARREN BUFFETT: A long time ago.

CHARLIE MUNGER: It was $10 a barrel. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: It wasn’t that long ago though, incidentally. That was in the 1990s, although we’ve seen oil a lot cheaper than that.

East Texas Oil sold for a dime a barrel in 1932.

The — we really don’t know.

I mean, obviously, you’re dealing with a finite resource. I don’t know whether the world is up to 88 million barrels or — it was down around 85 million barrels, but there’s got to be some comeback, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the current figure is getting pretty close to 88 million barrels a day.

That’s a lot of oil to take out of the ground every day. And, of course, there are — new frontiers have been found, but you are — you’ve stuck a lot of straws into the Earth, and it is a finite number.

So, the one thing I can promise you is — almost promise you — is that oil will sell for a lot more someday.

Interestingly enough, how many producing oil wells do you think there are in the United States?

The answer is something like 500,000. You know, there’s these stripper wells, there’s wells out near Charlie that have been going for a hundred years.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

WARREN BUFFETT: But we have looked in a lot of places now.

And what’s happening, of course, from the standpoint of United States companies, is that the smaller countries where oil is being found now are quite a bit smarter about how they grant their concessions than people were 50 or 75 or 100 years ago, so that they drive much more intelligent deals than was originally the case when we went exploring around the world.

But I have no idea — you know, we — traditionally, BNSF had hedged a certain amount of oil and — because they obviously use huge quantities of diesel — and I suggested to them — although how they run the BNSF is up to them — but I really didn’t think we could guess the price of oil.

And I thought if we could guess the price of oil, we didn’t need to run the railroad. I mean, it was a — took a lot of effort, time to run that railroad. And if we know how to make money just sitting in a room trading oil, why not do that instead?

So I don’t really — we don’t hedge — well, in terms of Berkshire’s parent company policies, we don’t hedge anything in the way of commodities. Some of our subsidiaries do, and that’s fine. They’re responsible for their businesses.

But there are very, very few commodities that I’ve ever thought I was going to — would know the direction of their movement in the next six months or a year.

The one thing I’m quite convinced of, as we talked about this morning, is the fact the dollar will become less valuable over time, so that the dollar price of most things will go up, and maybe go up very substantially.

Whether they go up enough so that you have the same amount of purchasing power after you pay tax on your nominal gains is another question.

I really think that an intelligent person can make more money, over time, thinking about assets that — productive assets — rather than speculating in commodities, or for that matter, fixed dollar investments, but that’s maybe my own bias.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, if we’d done nothing but oil from the very beginning, I’m confident that we would not have done nearly as well as we have.

To me, that’s perfectly obvious. So I think what we’ve done is much easier than what you’re trying to do.

WARREN BUFFETT: And we like easy.

CHARLIE MUNGER: We’re not trying to make it any more difficult than we have to.

WARREN BUFFETT: I really don’t know any way to have an edge in that sort of activity.

I mean, if you are going to try and figure out whether when to be long or short oil, or natural gas, or copper or cotton or whatever, I don’t know of people who I feel would have an edge in trying to do that over the next 10 years.

But I do know people where I think they’d have a very significant edge in investing in common stocks, and maybe distressed bonds, for that matter, too.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, trading oil worked best of all for the people who bribed Nigeria.

That’s not our milieu.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, that’s an insight I hadn’t heard before. (Laughter)

4. Clarification of the clarification on Sokol and Lubrizol

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky? Oh, I got Ron here.

RON OLSON: I wanted to clarify my clarification. (Laughter)

Sounds like a lawyer, doesn’t it?

WARREN BUFFETT: It sounds like a lawyer. (Laughter)

RON OLSON: Marc Hamburg was concerned that when I spoke of our insider trading policy and mentioned that we had a restricted list, that it — somebody may interpret that as suggesting that Lubrizol was on that restricted list. It was not.

What goes on our restricted list are securities that we have a position in that we publicly reported.

So I just simply wanted clarify that point. Lubrizol was not on the restricted list.

5. “I’m going to have Charlie write the next press release”

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Becky?

BECKY QUICK: Charlie, I’ve got several variations of this question, but this one comes from Peter Kerr (PH) in Waterloo, Canada.

He says, “Could you please let us know a couple of the most important things you learned during the last year?”

WARREN BUFFETT: I’ll let Charlie go first. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I hate to admit this because I’ve ignored high-tech all my life, but I actually read that book “In the Plex” about Google, and I found it a very interesting book.

And so here I am at my advanced age, and I find it interesting the way people have created these engineering cultures, which are quite peculiar and different from most of what we have at Berkshire.

And will I ever make any use of this? I doubt it. But I certainly enjoyed learning it.

And if I enjoy learning it, I regard it as important, because I think that’s what you’re here for, is to go to bed every night a little wiser than you were when you got up.

WARREN BUFFETT: I’m just trying to hold my own, actually. (Laughs)

What I learned in the last year is that I’m going to have Charlie write the next press release. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Warren, I approved that damn press release with no objections. (Laughter)

The Berkshire shareholders are going to be in terrible trouble if they’re relying on me to fix your errors. (Laughter)

6. CEO should be left “dead broke” after a bailout

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Let’s go to number 11.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

WARREN BUFFETT: Getting too close to confession time up here. (Laughter)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon, Warren and Charlie. My name is Phil Drew (PH), and I’m here with my wife Tina and our good friends the Grummys (PH) and the Henriksens (PH).

We’re all from Indianapolis, and we’re all small businesspeople. So we are not too big to fail.

And our question, basically, is simply this: do either of you gentlemen think that we might be headed down the same type of path years from now when we get into a situation as taxpayers, that we might have to bail out a company on Wall Street that is too big to fail? And if so, have we done anything to avert that?

WARREN BUFFETT: There are institutions around the world that I think governments should properly — although people won’t like it — but I think that there are institutions around the world that governments would properly — I think bailout has got a little bit of a pejorative term on it, in the sense that stockholders should not be saved, managers should not be saved — but certainly the institutions, in some cases, should not be allowed to collapse immediately.

I mean, right now, we’re continuing to follow that policy, for example, with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. I mean, they have not reconstituted themselves, as many of the banks and the auto companies.

I mean, Chrysler is even paying back, which, you know, surprises me, but my hat is off to them, and I mean that sincerely. I was really on the fence on saving the auto companies, but I think the administration did the right thing.

I mean, there were — they weren’t saving the auto companies, per se, they were still working at saving a very fragile economy.

And, like I say, particularly in retrospect, they certainly, in my view, made the right decision.

There are — right now, you know, in Europe they’re deciding whether countries are too big to fail.

And so I think that problem will always be with us.

I think for that reason that you have to do things to reduce the propensity to fail, and among those things, I think you have to make it so that the CEO, and to some extent the board — but not to the draconian degree that I’ll suggest for the CEO — I think that any institution that requires society to come and bail it out for society’s sake should have a system in place that leaves their CEO, basically, and his spouse, dead broke, because I think that the upside and downside incentives are vastly different. (Applause)

And I think the board of directors of those institutions should suffer severe penalties. Nothing like that, but they certainly, you know, should give back, say, the last five years of directors’ fees or whatever it may be that they received.

Because they — if you run an institution that actually needs — society can suffer such a blow if you fail — that society needs to come in and save you, you ought to have somebody running that institution, and you ought to have incentive practices in place that make it very, very, very painful to the people involved for the failure if it indeed happens.

And you also ought to reduce leverage in the system, and I think we’ve gone, to some degree, in that direction.

But there will be too big to fail institutions 10 years from now or 20 years from now. Right now Freddie Mac and Fanny Mae are sort of too big to figure out.

We just sit there — and incidentally, here’s nothing wrong with that. It’s more important to come up with the right solution than it is to come up with an immediate solution on those.

But particularly, I would say, in Europe there are banking institutions in countries that people are facing the question of whether they are too big to fail.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, my answer is that the past panics and depressions, by and large, started on Wall Street or in stock brokerages.

They tended to involve great waves of excessive speculation and bad behavior in the people who were profiting from those waves as salesman, or market makers, or promoters or what have you.

And I think that this last mess, which created so much danger, should have caused something like happened in the aftermath of the ’30s, where we prevented a new mess for a long, long time, but, of course, it hasn’t done that.

And so I think you can confidently expect a new mess or two before you career is over, and I think it is really stupid for our country to have allowed this.

Partly the failure is not one of evil, it’s one of stupidity. And part of the stupidity is in our great academic institutions who believe a whole lot of things that aren’t true. And that is a really hard problem to solve.

WARREN BUFFETT: You’re talking about particularly in finance?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes, of course, and economics, too.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Those are not hard sciences, finance and economics. And finance really attracts people who should have gone into snake charming or — (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: If there’s anybody we’ve forgotten to insult, just pass a note up, and we’ll get to you. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

7. No Washington Post shares will be sold after board resignation

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question comes from a shareholder based in Washington, DC, who has asked to remain anonymous.

This person says, “Warren, in the past year you and Melinda Gates resigned from the board of the Washington Post. What does this say about Berkshire’s intention to hold the Washington Post stock over the long term, and is this related to the problems at its for-profit education business, Kaplan?”

WARREN BUFFETT: No, I made this statement, actually, publicly, and they may have only run it in the Post, I’m not sure about elsewhere.

But I made the statement that we would not be selling any stock, and it had nothing to do with that, that I’m a phone call away from Don Graham or anybody else at the Post, and they can just save a lot of directors fees and I can save a lot of travel if at age 80 I decide that I’d rather spend a few more days at Berkshire and less on the road.

I am — we will not be selling any Post shares.

Normally I won’t comment about what we’ll do on marketable securities, but I’ll be unequivocal about that.

And my enthusiasm for the Post itself and the management is 100 percent what it’s always been, and I — I’m just available a lot cheaper than before if the Post management wants any advice.

I don’t think Melinda did it on the basis of age. You’ll have to ask her.

I really decided at 80 that I’d been there since 1974, with an interruption when I was at Cap Cities/ABC, and it’s just a lot easier this way.

Charlie, do you have any thoughts on serving on boards generally? Charlie is on the Costco board.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, that’s because I really admire Costco. And that’s one of the pleasures of my life, is interfacing with those people.

But that’s the only one where we don’t — where I don’t have a big ownership interest.

I think, generally speaking, serving on a whole lot of different boards is for the birds. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. I agree. (Laughs)

8. Can’t predict if Berkshire will outperform the Australian dollar

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Area 12.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. I’m Marc Rabinov from Melbourne, Australia.

As an investor from the Asian region, I am concerned that a weaker dollar will erode the value of my Berkshire stock.

However, Berkshire is highly productive with real pricing power, so can I be confident that over the long term any fall in the dollar will be offset by a rise in the value of my Berkshire stock? And by that I mean in addition to any intrinsic growth in the underlying business.

CHARLIE MUNGER: The answer is no. (Buffett laughs)

WARREN BUFFETT: It would be a lot easier if you just had the Australian dollar go down. The Australian dollar was one of two currencies that we did own last year that contributed to the $100 million profit.

But, no, I cannot tell you what policies will be followed in the United States and what policies will be followed in Australia that will — what they will be and how they will affect the relative value of those two currencies, say, 10 years from now.

I think the movement could be quite dramatic, and I think it actually could be dramatic in either direction. That’s why I don’t know what to do.

But the only promise you’ll get from Charlie and me about Berkshire is that we do every day, as I said in the annual report, try to think about increasing the earning power and the intrinsic value of Berkshire.

And to the degree we increase it, the shareholders will — or to the degree we decrease it — the shareholders will share in exactly the same proportion as Charlie and I do.

We will — our interests are 100 percent aligned. We will make or lose money through our stock and luck, to some extent, will depend — will determine — how well we do.

We know we can’t do remotely as well in the future as we have in the past.

There is no way to compound — there’s no way we know to compound the kind of sums we’re working with now at rates that are anywhere close to what we were able to do when working with much smaller sums. But you’ll get our best efforts.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: I can’t add to that.

Australia has these fabulous open pit mines, and at a time when Asia is just totally booming with its demand for metals, I can’t tell you how Berkshire stock is going to perform vis-a-vis mines in Australia.

I think we’ll do pretty well compared to companies here in the United States.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I think so, too.

9. We’re not neglecting the stock portfolio

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: This shareholder wishes to be known only by his initials, AJ.

The importance of Berkshire’s equity portfolio has diminished other the past few decades. Today I view Berkshire’s appetite for equity as an afterthought and instead see its focus as being on large acquisitions.

Would you agree with this, and where do you see the equity portfolio going over the next five or 10 years?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I prefer large acquisitions, but it’s not an afterthought at all in terms of the portfolio.

I mean, we — Charlie and I spend — well, we probably spend more time thinking about the portfolio because it’s only occasionally that we get a chance to think about acquisitions that are sizable and that are available to us.

So we are equally interested in both aspects of Berkshire’s operations. But where we hope we really get lucky is in adding significant companies to what we have already, and having our — the companies that we already own — make various bolt-on acquisitions.

We’ve had several of those already this year that you don’t read about.

A lot of our companies have the potential to do — to earn — considerably more money five or 10 years from now than they’re earning now.

So both the development of those businesses, which really resides with the managers — Charlie and I don’t contribute anything on that — but we will — we spend as much time thinking about the portfolio as we ever did.

And, you know, it’s important. I mean, if you talk about $150-some billion in cash and marketable securities, the performance of that particular segment is going to have a lot to do with how well Berkshire does over time.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, we’ll always have a fair amount of marketable securities because of our insurance subsidiaries and — but as we get forced by our size into the bigger and bigger stocks, of course we’re going to do less well than we did when we had a bigger universe of practicable things to consider.

WARREN BUFFETT: A lot less well. I mean, it really is the nature of things.

We are buying securities where we have to put billions of dollars in them in most cases, and that is not a field that is unlooked at by other analysts.

So it’s impossible to have a big edge. We hope we have a small edge.

CHARLIE MUNGER: On the other hand, when we were doing so well in marketable securities, nobody called us and said, I have a wonderful business, and you’re the only place in the world where I would want to transfer it.

And now that happens, what, a couple times a year at least?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

CHARLIE MUNGER: And I really prefer, in some ways, this part of the game to the earlier game. It’s more fun to create permanent partners doing constructive things than just outsmart other people and shuffling little pieces of paper.

WARREN BUFFETT: It’s fun to do both, actually. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. Well, I don’t see you holding back. (Buffett laughs)

10. “We have an unbelievable insurance operation”

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Let’s go to the other room. 13.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, I’m Whitney Tilson, a shareholder from New York. Thank you for including in your latest annual letter such complete and clear valuation information regarding Berkshire.

You stated that the operating earnings of the insurance businesses are excluded from your earnings table, and I know you said this morning that 2011 is going to be a break-even year at best.

But in light of the disclosure in the annual report that Berkshire earned $17 billion in profit over the last eight years without a single money-losing year, are you being overly conservative?

Don’t you think the intrinsic value of your insurance businesses is more than just their float, especially GEICO, for the reasons you discussed this morning?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I’d agree with that, Whitney, but I — it’s very hard to estimate, you know, what the normal underwriting profit might be — might be over the next 20 years or something of the sort.

And so I agree with you. I don’t know whether I’d call it overly conservative. I would say it’s conservative to assume break-even underwriting.

But as you — I mean, if we had another Katrina or something of the sort — and forget about, you know, winter storms in Europe and all that — I mean, we could lose significant money in underwriting this year, and we expect to lose significant money in underwriting, you know, maybe every fifth year, every tenth year, whatever it might be.

But I think you’re right in saying it would not be inappropriate to include some normalized underwriting profit in addition to the calculation that I made in the annual report.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Whitney, let me help you by asking another question of Warren. Is there any other large casualty insurance operation in the world that you know of that you would trade for ours?

WARREN BUFFETT: Not remotely — no, no. Nothing close. I mean, we — however we lucked into it, we’ve got — we have an unbelievable insurance operation.

And, I mean, GEICO, you know, is fabulous. And, you know, if you think about — since 1936, the idea has been out there, but, you know, with all the strength that all the other companies had, and the agency plants and everything else, GEICO has now moved to where it’s the third largest in the United States and gaining ground every day on the two ahead of them, and doing it very profitably.

GEICO’s combined ratio — GEICO had an underwriting profit of close to eight points, as I remember it, in the first quarter. Now that’s going to be, probably, the best quarter of the year, I should add, but it’s a marvelous business.

Ajit [Jain] has built an insurance business from scratch in the reinsurance business, that, in many respects, you know, he operates all alone.

He may not see a lot of transactions in any given period of time, but there are certain things, where if somebody wants huge amounts of insurance and a quick answer, or even a slow answer sometimes — we’ll give them a quick one — there’s really nobody else to call. It’s a little like Charlie mentioned on acquisition opportunities.

So he’s — and he’s done it. I mean, it didn’t exist when he got there.

Tad Montrose has got a magnificent operation at Gen Re. It had to get shaken out to quite a degree, but Tad has got a very, very disciplined business there.

And then we have a group of smaller companies that some of them have some very unusual franchises.

So there really — you know, I didn’t have anything to do with it, so I can brag about these people, but they have really done a job in building an insurance company that I don’t think there’s anything like it.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Some of you people that have been around a long time, you invested with an Omaha boy, and you ended up owning part of the best casualty insurance business in the world.

WARREN BUFFETT: If you go to 30th and Harney, you’ll see a building there, National Indemnities. We paid 7 million for National Indemnity, a million-four for its sister company National Fire & Marine, and that’s the same building that we operated out of in 1967, we’re operating out of today.

The only difference is that today it’s got more net worth than any insurance company in the world.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, so we — it’s not that great a business as a business, casualty insurance.

It’s a tough game. There are temptations to be stupid in it. It’s like banking. (Laughter)

And — but if you’re in it, I think we’ve got the best one.

11. Why See’s Candies does well in inflationary times

WARREN BUFFETT: With those modest statements, we’ll move onto Becky. (Laughs)

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from Mark Jordan (PH) in Charleston, South Carolina.

He writes, “In a period of high inflation, which particular businesses owned by Berkshire Hathaway will perform the best, and which will perform the worst and why?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, the businesses that will perform the best are the ones that require little capital investment to facilitate inflationary growth and that have strong positions that allow them to increase prices with inflation.

And, you know, we have a candy business, for example, and the value of the dollar since we bought that candy business has probably fallen at least 85 percent, I would say — 80 to 85 percent — and that candy business sells 75 percent more pounds of candy than it did when we bought it, but it has ten times the revenues and it doesn’t take a lot more capital.

So that kind of a business — any business that can — that has enough freedom to price to offset inflation and doesn’t commensurate invest — or huge investment — to support it, will do well.

Businesses like our utilities which get, in effect, a bond-like return but require — you know, if you’re going to build a generating plant and it costs twice as much per kilowatt hour of capacity, and all you’re going to get is a fixed return and yields on bonds go up, perhaps dramatically, to get high inflation, is not going to do that well in an inflationary period, just because it has certain aspects of a bond-like investment, and bonds generally are not going to do well in inflation.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, but like our insurance operations, our capital intensive railroad business is certainly one of the best railroads in the world. And our utility operations are certainly one of the best utility operations in the world.

And so it isn’t all bad to be up there, world class, in your main businesses.

WARREN BUFFETT: Our railroad — the government has talked about building a high-speed rail system in California.

I think they’re talking about 800 miles of track, and their estimated cost was about 43 billion, and estimated costs on construction and things like that go up dramatically much more often than they get reduced even by a minor amount.

And, of course, we paid 43 billion, counting debt assumed, for our rail system, which has 22,000 miles of main track and 6,000-plus locomotives, and 13,000 bridges, if you ever want to buy a bridge.

So that — the replacement value of that asset during inflation already is huge and it would grow dramatically, and the world — our country will always need rail transportation. So it — it is a terrific asset to own, I’ll just leave it at that.

12. “May you live until the A stock splits”

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Area 1 again.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: I’m Martin Greenberger, UCLA Anderson School, where I work in disruptive technologies, not finance.

WARREN BUFFETT: You’re forgiven. Go ahead. (Laughs)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: My friend Walt would like to know if Berkshire has been considering splitting its Type A shares, like it did its Type B shares, and if so, what are the pros and cons, in your opinion? And what would be the short-term and longer-term effects?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well, in effect, we’ve already split it, you know, 1500-for-one by having the B available.

And, you know, we have a situation where the company will never be sold, but if any transaction involves the A stock, the B shares are going to get treated exactly the same. So there’s really no disadvantage to owning the B stock, except it has somewhat less voting power than the A stock.

But in every other way it’s the same instrument, and so we already have a split stock available.

So I would tell Walt that he really should not count heavily on the A stock getting split.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, Warren used to cheer up his old friends by telling them, may you live until the A stock splits. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: And I would love to make that deal myself. (Laughs)

13. Buffett’s best deal: hiring Ajit Jain

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question comes from Matthew Palmer of North Andover, Massachusetts.

And he writes, “Mr. Buffett, you have praised [Berkshire Hathaway reinsurance chief] Ajit [Jain] as a possible successor. Since he may be in line as our next CEO, can you give us a concrete example of a policy that he’s written that’s impressed you, and can you talk a little about the way he thinks since we rarely get an opportunity to hear from him?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, Ajit is not exactly a publicity hound.

Ajit — (laughs) — he —

I can’t think of any decision he’s ever made that I think I could have made better.

And I’ve — I’m not privy to all of his transactions anymore. There just — there are lots of them that are not of huge size or of great interest, but he tells me about all the interesting things that come along and all the very big things that come along. And I would say this: you’d be better off voting with him than with me after listening to any proposition he brings up.

He is as rational a thinker as Charlie is, as anybody I’ve met. He loves what he does.

He’s creative. He’s very creative. We have moved into one area after another in reinsurance when people came in copying us in one area of business that we would be operating in. Ajit comes up with something else.

Lately we’ve been much more active in life reinsurance, but who knows tomorrow brings. I mean, if there happens to be a huge cat in the third quarter of this year or something of the sort, that might open up all kinds of opportunities in writing covers when — if capacity got strained.

But who knows what will happen. All I know is that Ajit’s mind works like a machine, you know, day after day. And he does love what he does, which is an important part of doing well at any activity.

And I really — I don’t know what his best deal was. I know what my best deal was, which was hiring him.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. Sir William Osler, who created a model medical school for the world, used to say that the secret of success in a field is getting very interested in it.

Well, Ajit is real interested in what he does. Many of you don’t know this, but every Thanksgiving, Ajit flies to London because they don’t have a Thanksgiving holiday. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: We give him Christmas off, though. (Laughter)

Ajit, we just — he — I say how invaluable he is, and I’m not exaggerating when we talk about him. He is — to an extraordinary degree, he thinks of Berkshire first.

Ajit, at various periods when insurance companies became popular for one reason or another, there was, you know, there was the big thing about Bermuda companies some few years ago, Ajit could have monetized himself to an incredible degree. Still could do it.

I mean, people would hand him a significant percentage of any company being formed with lots of money, so that immediately he could create, I would guess, in the hundreds of millions of wealth without lifting a finger, just by somebody putting up, you know, a couple billion dollars and saying you’ve got 20 percent of it or whatever it may be.

I mean, listen, he’s smart. He knows that, and it doesn’t cross his mind to do anything like that.

I mean, he — we have, in comp — he always thanks me for what I do at the end of the year, and I feel I’ve left off a zero, you know, when I get all through. (Laughs)

He’s just a remarkable human being. And we are very, very lucky that, I think, he has a lot of fun in what he does at Berkshire.

He’s got a cadre of about 30 people that work with him. There’s many more that are settling claims and doing that sort of thing on runoff business, but it’s — you won’t find anything like it, in my view, not only in the insurance world, but really in almost any part of the business world. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: Let’s go —

CHARLIE MUNGER: You didn’t answer the question. Maybe you avoided it on purpose.

WARREN BUFFETT: Oh.

CHARLIE MUNGER: He said, what are our worst businesses?

WARREN BUFFETT: What are our worst businesses?

Well, generally speaking — and this is general — I have — well, made certain mistakes in going into smaller businesses that really never had the potential of becoming big.

But I would say overall, probably, I would call retailing — you know, Dexter was our worst business, but I’ve — the Furniture Mart, obviously, is a terrific operation. But we have not made — despite being in numerous retailing — quite a few — retailing business for quite a while, we have not created major earning power there.

Wouldn’t you agree on that, Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, but luckily it’s a small part of the operation.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

CHARLIE MUNGER: But you’re right. That’s been the hardest game for us. And, you know, if we were a little smarter we could have figured that out better. (Laughs)

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, if we were a little smarter we could have done a lot of things. (Laughs)

Of course, See’s is a retailing business, to some degree.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes.

WARREN BUFFETT: And we had enormous success there, so maybe we started thinking we were geniuses. We are like the duck on the pond when it was raining, and we thought we were rising in the world because of merit and it was just because it was raining. (Laughter)

14. “Forget about goodwill” when evaluating a business

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. We’ll go to number 2.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Joe Tellinghas (PH), Boston, Massachusetts.

What’s the proper way to think about goodwill and return on capital?

Berkshire’s manufacturing, service, and retail businesses earn pretax returns on tangible capital over 20 percent, which suggests either skilled managers or fantastic businesses. But the return on allocated equity is in the single digits, which looks drab.

Accountants treat intangibles similarly because they have different economics. (Inaudible)

For an indestructible brand like See’s or Coca-Cola, I can see why the intangibles should not be amortized because it’s worth more every year, and your comments on GEICO policyholders were one way to think about that.

But all the tobacco companies have billions of dollars of goodwill in unit sales of cigarettes to claim every year in developed countries, so perhaps they should be amortized. And for Time Warner- AOL, goodwill definitely needed to be amortized.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, goodwill — you mention AOL-Time Warner or something of the sort, it should be written off, actually. It was just a mistake in purchase price.

Goodwill should not be used in evaluating the fundamental attractiveness of a business. There you should look at return on tangible assets, and even then there’s some minor — some other adjustments you may want to make.

But basically, in evaluating the businesses we own, in terms of what the management are doing and what the underlying economics of the business are, forget about goodwill.

In terms of evaluating the job we’re doing in allocating capital, you have to include goodwill, because we paid for it.

So if we buy — you know, Coca-Cola goes back to 1886 and John Pemberton at Jacobs Pharmacy in Atlanta, and there was not a whole lot of goodwill put on the books when he sold that first Coca-Cola.

If you were to buy the company now, the whole company, you’d be putting a figure, you know, of 100 billion or something like that on it.

You shouldn’t amortize that, and you shouldn’t, in judging the economics of the business, look at that.

But in terms of judging the economics of the business that purchased it — we’ll call it Berkshire — then you have to allow for the goodwill, because we are allocating capital and paying a lot for it.

I don’t think the amortization of goodwill makes any sense. I think write-offs of it, when you find out you’ve made the wrong purchase and the business doesn’t earn commensurate with the tangible assets employed plus the goodwill, I think write-offs of it make sense.

But when looking at businesses as to whether they’re good businesses, mediocre businesses, poor businesses, look at the return on net tangible assets.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I think that’s right. But as the gentleman says, when we buy a business, a whole business, we never get a huge bargain and, of course, we may get down toward 10 percent pretax earnings on what we pay.

That isn’t so awful as you think when you — a lot of the money comes from insurance float that costs you nothing.

In other words, if you have 60 billion of float and God gives you 6 billion a year earnings, it’s not all bad.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, on Lubrizol we’re paying close to 9 billion for the equity, and it earns — and you should make adjustments for debt but it’s not an important factor there — and, you know, current rate of earnings is probably a billion pretax.

And now Lubrizol itself is employing far — you know, they’re employing, you know, call it 2 1/2 billion of equity to earn that billion of pretax, so it’s a very good business, in terms of the assets that are employed. But when we end up paying the premium we pay to buy into it, it becomes a billion pretax on something close to 9 billion.

You have to judge us based on close to a $9 billion investment. You have to judge James Hambrick in running the business based on the much lower capital that he has employed.

It can turn out to be a very good business, and we could turn out to have made at least a minor mistake if it isn’t as good a business as we think it is now, but still is a very satisfactory business based on the tangible capital employed.

Charlie, can you make that clearer? (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, it’s just — we are not going to buy, in the climate we’re in now, operating businesses that are at all decent for low prices. It’s just not going to happen.

15. Munger really loves Costco

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: In a book about Charlie, “Damn Right!” by Janet Lowe, Charlie talks about his view on teaching finance.

He says that he would use the histories of a hundred or so companies that did something right or wrong as a basis for teaching the course.

Could each of you — and since this concerned Charlie, could each of you — we’ll start with Charlie — give us an example or two from either category, right moves or wrong moves?

WARREN BUFFETT: I predict Charlie is going to talk about Costco. Go ahead, Charlie. (Laughs)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, Costco, of course, is a — (laughter) — a business that became the best in the world in its category, and it did it with an extreme meritocracy and an extreme ethical duty, self-imposed, to take all its cost advantages as fast as it could accumulate them and pass them onto the customers. And, of course, that created ferocious customer loyalty.

And it’s been a wonderful business to watch, and, of course, strange things happen when you do that and do that long enough.

Costco has one store in Korea that will do over 400 million in sales this year. These are figures that can’t exist in retailing, but, of course, they do.

And so that’s an example of somebody having the right managerial system, the right personnel selection, the right ethics, the right diligence and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. That is quite rare.

And if you — if once or twice in a lifetime you’re associated with such a business, you’re a very lucky person.

And the more normal business is a business like, say, General Motors, which became the most successful business of its kind in the world and wiped out its common shareholders, what, last year?

That is a very interesting story, and if I were teaching in a business school, I would have Value Line-type figures that took people through the entire history of General Motors. And I would try and relate the changes in the graph and in the data to what happened in the business.

And to some extent, they faced a really difficult problem: heavily unionized business, combined with great success, and very tough competitors who came up from Asia and elsewhere, and to some extent from Europe. And that is a real problem, which, of course — to prevent wealth from killing you, your success turning into a disadvantage, is a big problem in business.

And so there are all these wonderful lessons in those graphs. And I don’t know why people don’t do it. The graphs don’t even exist that I would use to teach.

I can’t imagine anybody being dumb enough not to have the kind of graphs I yearn for. (Laughter)

But so far as I know there’s no business school in the country that’s yearning for these graphs.

Partly the reason they don’t want it is if you taught a history of business this way you’d be trampling on the territories of all the little professors in subdisciplines. You’d be stealing some of their best cases.

And in bureaucracies, even academic bureaucracies, people protect their own turf. And, of course, a lot of that happened at General Motors. (Applause)

Yeah.

It’s a — I really think the world — that’s the way it should be taught. Harvard Business School once taught it much that way, and they stopped.

I’d like to make a case study as to why they stopped. (Laughter)

I think I can — I think I can successfully guess. It’s that, of course, the history of business trampled on the territory of barons of other disciplines like the baron of marketing, the baron of finance, the baron of whatever.

And IBM is an interesting case. I mean, there’s just one after another that are utterly fascinating, and I don’t think they’re properly taught at all because nobody wants to do the full sweep.

WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie and I were on a plane recently that was hijacked.

CHARLIE MUNGER: With what?

WARREN BUFFETT: It was hijacked. I’m telling about our experience on that hijacked plane when the hijackers picked us out as the two dirty capitalists that they really had to execute.

But they were a little abashed about it. They didn’t really have anything against us, so they said that each of us would be given one request before they shot us, and they turned to Charlie and they said, “What would you like as your request?”

Charlie said, “I would like to give once more my speech on the virtues of Costco, with illustrations.” (Laughter)

And the hijacker said, “Well, that sounds pretty reasonable to me.”

And he turned to me and said, “And what would you like, Mr. Buffett?”

And I said, “Shoot me first.” (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Anyway.

16. Incentivizing kids

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Number 3.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sumat Mehra (PH) from Kashmir in India. Mr. Buffett, hope you enjoyed your first trip to India.

WARREN BUFFETT: I sure did.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Here’s my question. One of the most important things that drive people are incentives, but if you live in a rich society it’s very hard to get your kids to work hard and reach their full potential because they just don’t need to.

So if you or Charlie decide to have a kid in the next five years — (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: It would be a star in the east.

WARREN BUFFETT: It will take more than a decision. (Laughter)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: How would you incentivize him or her —

WARREN BUFFETT: I thought you were going to say, “How would you?” (Laughter)

No, it’s a good question. I apologize for interrupting.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: How would you incentivize him or her to compete among the hungry and highly motivated kids from emerging markets like China, Brazil, Russia, or India?

WARREN BUFFETT: I think certainly that if you are very rich and you bring up your kids to think that they are more important in society, or that they have some special privilege, simply because they came out of the right womb, that, you know, that’s just a terrible mistake.

But Charlie has raised eight children that I know quite well, most of them, and I don’t think any of them have that sense.

But it’s — if you really are going to raise your kids to think that other people should do all the work for them and that they will be entitled to sit around and fan themselves for the rest of their lives, I mean, you know, you will probably not get a good result.

I — you know, in my — Charlie has been rich most of the time when his kids — many of his kids — were growing up — some of his kids were growing up,

I’ve been rich while my kids were getting — certainly when they got into high school and college — but I don’t think — I certainly didn’t want to give them the idea that they were special just because their parents were rich.

And I don’t think you necessarily have to get a bad result or have children that don’t have any incentives simply because their parents are rich.

The one thing I don’t think you want to give them an incentive to do is try and outdo their parents at what their parents happen to be good at.

I don’t think that makes sense, whether if you are a professional athlete, or a rich person, or whatever it may be, a great novelist, you name it.

But I really think if you’re rich and your kids turn out to have no incentives, I don’t think you should point at them. I think you should probably point at yourself.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I don’t think you can raise children in an affluent family and have them love working 60 hours a week in the hot sun digging fence post holes or something. That’s not going to work.

So to some extent, you are destroying certain kinds of incentives. And my advice to you is to lose your fight as gracefully as you can. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: I’m not sure if you’re poor if you can get your kids to love the idea of working 60 hours a week. They may have to, but —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Kids that really get interested in something will work no matter how rich they are.

But it’s rare to have an Ajit-like intensity of interest.

You know, if you were a proctologist, you might not like your day as it went on and on. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: I think we better move along. Becky? (Laughter)

17. Compensation incentives for Berkshire’s next CEO

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from a shareholder from central Iowa who asks, “Berkshire Hathaway does well, in part, because its managers want to be there for nonpecuniary reasons. But it seems likely that the next operations CEO will be best be filled by someone who insists on a salary of more than $100,000.

“What kind of compensation structure do you expect for the next generation of Berkshire leadership?”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I think the next CEO will make a lot of money and should make a lot of money.

I mean, the responsibility for running a company with a couple hundred billion dollars of market value should pay well.

I think that whatever the level the board decides then, in terms of a base salary, should be supplemented by, probably, an option system that incorporates a couple things that are perhaps unusual.

I don’t think the option price — the original strike price — should be less than if the company were for sale, the assets would bring.

So the idea of giving somebody an option during some depressed part of the stock market at the market price, I think, is crazy because you wouldn’t sell your business at that price and why sell part of it on that basis.

So I think the base price should be what the business is worth at the time you start, and then I think if, because of the compounding feature of leaving money there — you know, no management at all would produce some gain in value over time — so I think there should be an increase in the base price annually at some rate, and then minus the dividend that’s being paid.

So, if you assume a 3 percent dividend was paid, and you wanted to have a hurdle rate of increasing at 7 or 8 percent a year, then you would have the option price accelerate, maybe, at 4 or 5 percent.

But with that kind of a structure, I think you can give a very large option because you — if somebody is creating excess value above a given rate on a very large sum, I think they deserve something quite significant in terms of that excess earned.

Now, they — the present compensation system has no relevance at all to what my successor should earn. The main thing is getting the right person with the right values who interacts well with the managers and who knows how to allocate capital.

And as you just heard a little earlier, our managers who accomplish a lot, if they — and if they’re working with big operations so that it turns into a lot of dollars — they can make a lot of money with Berkshire.

They — nothing is worked off the eccentricities of Charlie and me at the top level.

So, you know, people make well into eight figures, sometimes, at Berkshire. But they earn it, and they don’t get it because of any phony targets or anything of that sort. They get it because they really deliver incredible, in some cases, excess value to Berkshire.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I hope it will be a long time in the future, and I don’t regard it as absolutely inconceivable that Warren’s spot will someday be occupied by a very rich man who has adopted Warren’s system of pay.

I think somebody in America has to be the exemplar for not grabbing all that you can. I think it’s a very important part of the whole scheme. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: I don’t think you better run an ad, though, after I go, that says CEO wanted, $100,000 pay plus pleasant surroundings. (Laughs)

18. Societal issues are important but don’t affect investment decisions

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. We’ll go to number 4.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger. My name is Vern Cushenbery and this question is on behalf of a group of investors that made the trip up today from Overland Park, Kansas.

Given your interest in renewable energy and natural resources, I wonder if you’d be willing to share your thoughts on how a world of limited and depleting clean water supplies and declining food stocks affects your investment strategies and thinking on the future.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I would say it’s an important subject but it doesn’t affect our investment strategy to any real degree.

In other words, you know, we would love to buy another GEICO. We would love to buy another BNSF. We’d love to buy another MidAmerican.

And we look at those businesses over a long time frame, but we are looking at what we expect their earning power to be three, five, 10, 15 years down the road compared to what we are paying.

So I would say that there are a number of societal issues that really do not enter into our investment or purchase of business-type decisions.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I would advise not paying too much attention to the clean water issue. If there’s enough energy, you can always get enough clean water.

Israel sometimes goes month after month making half its water from sea water. With enough energy, why, you have — the water problem goes away. And that’s very helpful in considering the future.

And regarding the agricultural productivity, I think one of the main reasons for being restrained in the use of hydrocarbons is that modern agriculture won’t work without them.

So I’m a great believer in being conservative, in terms of blowing all the hydrocarbons on heating houses and running cars. I think that — think of how happy we’d be if we’d taken a bunch of that dollar oil in the Middle East and just carted it here and put it in salt caverns.

I mean you could argue that we really screwed up the past, and you could argue all the people who think that our main solution is to drill, drill, drill. They’re all nuts. (Laughter and applause)

It’s probably quite wise to use up the other fellow’s hydrocarbon while preserving our own.

It’s not going away because we are not drilling it now.

But you can see that this will lead into unproductive discussion. (Laughter)

19. We wouldn’t participate in an auction for any company

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. We’ll move right onto Andrew.

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This next question, actually, just came in by email from someone in the audience from their BlackBerry, actually a prominent investor that asked that his name not be named.

And his question is the following: He writes, “Your purchase of Lubrizol was done in a negotiated transaction. The board of Lubrizol did not market the company for sale nor run an auction.

“According to the proxy, you did not permit the company to run a go-shop process, despite the requests you allow them to do so.

“Did the board of Lubrizol breach its fiduciary duty by not running a more competitive process to sell the company? And if not, why not?”

CHARLIE MUNGER: Let me do this.

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Charlie will. (Laughter)

He volunteers —

CHARLIE MUNGER: The answer is no, the board at Lubrizol did not breach its duty because we were not going to participate in the transaction if they didn’t do it our way. (Laughter and applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we basically don’t participate in auctions.

And actually, just very, very recently we were asked to participate in one, and we’re just not interested.

They may end up getting less money than they would have gotten from us. But if they want to auction it, the one thing I can guarantee them, you know, is that when they get all through, we will not pay them what we would have them paid originally if they stepped up.

So they get a very certain deal, they got a very significant price, in my view, and in the view of two advisors.

And if they had said we want to conduct an auction, we would have said good luck, and we’d have looked at something else.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Has anybody else got an easy question? (Laughter)

20. How to judge if Buffett is doing a good job of allocating capital

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Number 5.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Charlie. I think I have an easy question. My name is —

WARREN BUFFETT: Give it to me then. (Laughter)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Stuart Kaye from Matarin Capital Management in Stanford, Connecticut.

And, Warren, you’ve often described a big part of your job is allocating capital.

Going forward, by just looking at Berkshire’s financial statements, how can we determine how good of a job you have done at allocating capital?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, the real test will be whether the earnings progress at a rate that’s commensurate with the amount of capital that’s being retained. And over time, a market value test — but markets can be very volatile and capricious — but over time, obviously, we — unless the market value of Berkshire is significantly greater than the amount of capital that we have kept from you, retained, and used to buy businesses, you know — the verdict is against us if we ever start selling at a discount to that factor.

But you just have — and, you know, it is not a perfect measurement and certainly is not on any three-month or six months or even one-year basis, but over time, if we’re going to keep your money, we have to earn a better-than-average return on that money we keep and that has to translate into the stock selling at a premium over the money we retain from you.

And so far we’ve done OK on that, but the job gets tougher every year.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. We have continued to beat the market averages. We just aren’t beating our own past record. And I guarantee that will continue, at least the last half of it. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Only the last half of it, right?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

21. Don’t compare opportunities now to your best-ever deal

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: This question is from Mike Rifkin (PH). He wants to ask about five transactions you’ve made in recent years with very different terms.

Goldman, 5 billion at 10 percent plus warrants; GE, five billion at ten percent plus warrants; Dow Chemical, 3 billion at 8.5 percent convertible to common; Wrigley- M&M Mars, 4.4 billion at 11.45; Swiss Re 2.7 billion at 12 percent.

Now, why the different interest rates you set and how about why the warrants in some cases, and why did the rich Mars family need 4.4 billion to do a deal, and at 11.45 percent?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we’ll let the Mars family speak for themselves.

But in terms of comparing those five deals, it was 3 billion with GE, and the Mars deal actually involved a $2.1 billion preferred stock, which has some usual characteristics, so you have to look at it as a package.

But the important thing is that every one of these deals was done at a different time, although the Goldman and the GE deals were done in close proximity with each other.

And market conditions — you know, you heard Charlie in the movie talk about opportunity costs. Our opportunity costs were different in every single one of those five transactions. And incidentally, we could have done a much better — I could have done a much better — job of allocating our money, you know, in terms of the post-panic period.

I was early on Goldman and GE, compared to the situation five months later. But, you know, we don’t have — we not only don’t have perfect foresight, sometimes it’s pretty bad.

But each deal — when I did the Swiss Re deal, I was not thinking about the Dow Chemical deal, which was committed to, maybe, a year-plus earlier. I was thinking about what else I could do with $2.7 billion, and that’s the way all the decisions are made.

So they are not related — they’re not related to each other. They go through a mind that is looking at everything available that day, including the amount of cash we have, the likelihood of being able to do something else next week or next month, what else we can do that day. And past deals we’ve made don’t really make any difference.

In fact, one of the things — one of the errors people make in business — and sometimes it can be a huge error — is that they try and measure every deal against the best deal they’ve ever made.

So they say, you know, I made this wonderful deal for, maybe, an insurance policy written, or it might be a company bought, it might be a stock bought, and they’re determined that they’re never going to make a deal that isn’t that attractive in the future.

So they, in effect — sometimes they take themselves out of the game.

The goal is not to make a better deal than you’ve ever made before. The goal is to make a satisfactory deal that’s the best deal you can make at the time. And Charlie relates it to marriage, and I’ll let him expand on that. (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: No, those are — of course, we’re going to make different deals at different times based on different opportunity costs. There’s no other rational way to make deals.

22. You don’t have to read quickly but you should read

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. We’ll go to number 6.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Keith McGowan, Norfolk, Massachusetts. Thank you, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. Thank you for being a role model.

Your ethics, frugality, sense of humor, honesty, sharing your ideas on investing, sharing your ideas on business, make this world a better place for everyone. (Applause)

Charlie mentioned in a prior answer about continuous learning. Mr. Buffett, you read about five newspapers a day. You also read many annual reports and other business-related reports.

You have the ability to read much faster than the vast majority of people. Reading is a fantastic thing.

What advice would you give to children in high school, college, or adults who want to increase their ability to read faster?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you know that’s an interesting question because I do read, as you described, the five papers and lots of 10Ks and 10Qs.

Unfortunately, I’m not a fast reader, and I’m not as fast as I used to be on reading.

But I don’t know how effective various speed reading classes may be, but if they are effective, you know, I would — I would really suggest anybody that can improve their speed — I wish I could read a lot faster than I can.

Charlie can read faster than I can. And it’s a huge advantage to be able to read fast.

And, you know, there’s a that old Woody Allen story about how he took the speed reading course, and he met somebody, he was telling him how wonderful it was, and the guy said, “Well, give me an example.”

And Woody Allen said, “Well,” he said. “I read ‘War and Peace’ last night in 20 minutes. It’s about Russia.” (Laughter)

That’s the problem I have when I try and read fast. I get all through reading the book, and I say, it’s about business, you know, so —

I really don’t know the effectiveness of speed reading-type courses, but if you know of any friends or — you can learn more about that, and there are effective techniques.

Obviously, the thing to do is to learn them very young because there really — there’s nothing — there’s hardly anything more pleasurable, you know, than reading and reading and reading and reading.

And Charlie and I do a lot of it. We continue do a lot of it. But I don’t do it as fast as I would like to.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I think speed is overestimated. I had a roommate at Caltech who had a very distinguished mind, and I could do problems faster than he could, but he never made a mistake, and I did. (Laughter)

So, I wouldn’t be too discouraged if you have to go a little slower. What the hell difference does it make? (Laughter and applause)

Pass that peanut brittle, Warren.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Thank you. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: You may have noticed we have a 15-pound box out for sale in the other room, but Charlie is looking for a 25-pound box.

23. Buffett: There shouldn’t even be a debt ceiling

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from Eric Wiseman (PH) who asks, “Are you worried about Congress playing politics with the raising of the debt ceiling? What would this do to Berkshire Hathaway stock and to the overall economy?”

WARREN BUFFETT: You mean if they didn’t raise it?

BECKY QUICK: If they didn’t raise it, right.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, well. It would probably be the most asinine, you know, act that Congress has ever performed.

One time in Indiana back in the 1890s, I think they passed a bill — I know it was introduced — you can look it up on a search engine. They passed a bill to change the value of pi, the mathematical term pi, to an even 3 — (laughter) — because they said it would be easier for the school children to work with.

Well, that’s the only bill I can think of that would give competition to a refusal to raise the debt ceiling.

I mean, it’s extraordinary. I mean, it really is extraordinary that with our deficit running, you know, well over $100 billion a month, and all kinds of items that can’t be changed — I mean, there’s — having a debt ceiling to start with is a mistake.

I mean, it doesn’t — the United States of 2011 has a different debt capacity than the United States of 1911, and we’re always — it’s going to be a growing country, and we’re going to have a growing debt capacity.

That doesn’t mean I think it’s a great idea at all to have debt growing, as a percentage of GDP.

But this — the debt ceiling’s on — so that these games get played and all the time that gets wasted and everything, and, you know, the amount of — number of — silly statements that you hear. It just seems such a waste of time for a country that’s got a lot of things to do.

But in the end, they won’t, in my view — there’s no chance that they don’t increase the debt ceiling and I would love to see them — well, I’d love to see them eliminate the idea, because it results in these periodic kind of stalemate operations where everybody uses it for posturing purposes and everything of the sort.

The United States is not going to have a debt crisis of any kind as long as we keep issuing our notes in our own currency. You know, the difference between being able to borrow in your own currency and having to borrow in another currency is night and day.

The only thing we have to worry about is the printing press and inflation. And if you’re a member of the euro, European Monetary Union, you have to worry about — you can’t print money. You can go and get your co-members to try and help you out.

But giving up the right to issue debt in your own currency is a huge step. And the United States has not done it. I don’t know whether we’ve ever issued U.S. bonds in any other currency but we certainly haven’t made a habit of it.

And the Japanese, incidentally, which have a very ratio of debt-to-GDP, also have consistently borrowed in their own currency.

And believe me, when it’s time to pay somebody back, and you have a choice of paying — and you’re forced to pay somebody else’s currency versus paying in your own — it’s entirely a different proposition.

As a matter of fact, Charlie and I, we were trying to buy that bank back in —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Chicago.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, in Chicago in the late 1960s, and this was a time of really tight money.

And tight money was different then than tight money is today. I mean, tight money meant no money.

And somebody — we wanted to buy this bank, and they wanted — the only place we could find some money, I think, was in Kuwait in dinars, wasn’t it?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Kuwaiti dinars. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: And I thought to myself, and Charlie concurred, who the hell knew what they were going to say the value of the dinar was when we went to pay it back. It was not something over which we had a lot of control. So we decided not to borrow the money in dinars even though I kind of wish we’d bought the bank.

Charlie, do you have anything to say on that?

CHARLIE MUNGER: No. (Laughter)

I do think — I do think — you know, I remember an era when we had a bipartisan foreign policy and all that, and I liked that era. And that was the Marshall Plan, and a lot of wonderful constructive things were done, and they were generous things.

Now, it seems to me that both parties are trying to compete to see who can be the most stupid — (laughter) — and they keep topping one another. (Laughter and applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: You can tell Charlie is a fellow who has always filed an accurate income tax form. (Laughter)

He’s not worried.

24. Nuclear power is “important” and “safe”

WARREN BUFFETT: Number 7.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. I’m John Gorrie (PH) from Iowa City, Iowa, where I’m a happy customer of MidAmerican Energy.

Around 2004, Mr. Buffett, you told us of a great attention you had given to limiting Berkshire’s exposure to mega-catastrophes so that one could not break Berkshire.

Today, MidAmerican Energy is seeking approval to build a nuclear power plant in eastern Iowa. At the same time, another utility company, Tokyo Electric and Power, faces claims that Merrill Lynch has estimated as exceeding 12 trillion yen, or $140 billion, to compensate residences and businesses that have been displaced and farmers that cannot produce.

Do you believe that the bond-like return that MidAmerican Energy might receive from a nuclear power plant can justify the mega-catastrophe risk that it would pose to Berkshire?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I don’t think it does pose — I don’t know the details of it, and Greg Abel can speak to it better than I can, but I don’t think there’s anything like the exposure that you refer to.

I think nuclear power is an important part of the world’s equation, really, in dealing with its problems on — it’s very long term because you’re not going to change the installed base in any hurry.

And as you know, France has a very high percentage of nuclear power. And, actually, 20 percent of the electricity generated in the United States comes from nuclear power.

I probably am getting some of mine from — we have — at Fort Calhoun, we have a nuclear facility — not we, but Omaha Public Power District has a nuclear facility I’ve actually been in.

But I think nuclear power is important, and I think it’s safe. I think that — I know — I don’t think nuclear power is going to go any place in the United States for a while — maybe quite a while — because of the reaction to what happened in Tokyo — with Tokyo Electric Power.

But that doesn’t change my view as to the advisability of continuing to develop nuclear power, not only in the United States, but around the world.

I think some people misinterpreted what I said when I was interviewed, when I said that I thought it would have a major setback in its development, just because of the popular reaction to what happened in Japan.

But that does not change my view that nuclear power is important for the future of this country and the world.

Charlie? (Applause)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, we can’t be so risk averse that things that have a very tiny chance of making a big dent in one subsidiary are unendurable for us. We have to have a certain reasonable amount of courage in operating this company.

WARREN BUFFETT: We have pipelines — we have gas pipe — you can dream of all kinds of worst-case situations.

We have to carry toxic materials. We’re required by law to carry those on the railroad, and, you know, you can picture the wrong place, the wrong time, the wrong everything. But we are not bearing any risks, in my view, ever, that threaten the enterprise.

I mean, that is one thing I think about all the time. I regard myself as the Chief Risk Officer of Berkshire, and that is not something to be delegated to a committee, in my view, at all.

So I think about — whether I think about derivative positions, whether I think about leverage, whether I’m thinking about nuclear power plants or anything, I mean, we are not doing anything that I know of that — pressing my imagination as far as I can — threatens me losing a night’s sleep over Berkshire’s well-being.

CHARLIE MUNGER: And I think you’d also count on any new nuclear plant built in Iowa will be a hell of a lot safer than the ones we already have. We are learning as we go along here. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Obviously, more people — more people have lost their lives, by far, in coal mine accidents, you know, than ever in the United States — have suffered no losses from anything involving nuclear — with it producing 20 percent of the electricity used by 309 million people.

CHARLIE MUNGER: And if a tsunami gets to Iowa, it will a hell of a tsunami. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. And our railroad won’t do so well, either. (Laughter)

25. Charity program fell victim to pressure groups

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question comes from Mary and Jim Beaumont (PH) from Springfield, Illinois. They’ve been Berkshire shareholders since 1971, and I should note that we received several questions from some long-term shareholders along these lines, and this one reads:

“Would Berkshire ever consider reinstating its shareholder-directed charitable giving program now that you have a big cash position and are urging people to give away their wealth to worthy causes?

“When you had that program, we were able to support many local schools and charities over the years.”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I love that program, which we had for, maybe, 20 or so years. Charlie loved it. A lot of the shareholders loved it.

And it was interesting because it was a tax-efficient way to let shareholders give away some money to whatever they chose, as long as it was a 501(c)(3), and they could pick up to three charities.

And some families, for example, used it as a learning device. When they would get the form from us, they’d get their kids around the table and they’d talk about philanthropy and why they were choosing what they did.

Two things — well, one thing that was very interesting about it is nobody else copied it. I mean, the rest of corporate America was not interested in having their shareholders direct contributions. They were much more interested in having the CEO direct contributions. So it did not catch on, despite a fair amount of publicity.

We always had a small backlash of sorts from people who didn’t like the charities that our shareholders were choosing.

So Berkshire’s name was on the check. The shareholders would tell us we want $20 a share, let’s say — and they own ten shares, so they can direct $200 — they’d say, we want our $200 to go to more —churches and synagogues, actually, were number one — but there were schools and there were all kinds of things.

And we would always get some letters where Berkshire would be contributing to, say, Planned Parenthood of California, and people would say, “Well, we’re not going to buy See’s Candy because Berkshire is supporting Planned Parenthood in California.”

And sometimes I would write the people a letter and tell them that when See’s bought almonds or milk or anything like that we didn’t get into the charitable preferences of the person supplying us, but it never really amounted to anything.

Then we bought the Pampered Chef, and that was a different situation because with the Pampered Chef we operated through 50,000-plus independent contractors.

These are women, largely, women, who sometimes, to supplement their income — we have at least one in the office that — a woman that sells Pampered Chef products — sometimes as a main source of income — were — these 50,000 were independent contractors, and a campaign developed where people said that because Berkshire Hathaway gives money, probably primarily to pro-choice organizations, and that was at the direction — we had other people giving them to pro-life organizations.

I mean, these reflected the views of our shareholders, not of Berkshire management — but that they were going to boycott these independent contractors.

And these were people who depended on the income, who had nothing to do with Berkshire’s policies, and they were being hurt, in terms of their livelihood, and in some cities it became a radio campaign, and in some cities people regularly started interfering with the parties arranged for our Pampered Chef consultants.

And it was hurting a whole lot of innocent people who had nothing to do with Berkshire’s policies, who had nothing to do with Berkshire.

And at that time, reluctantly, we decided to end the program.

I did not — I didn’t mind at all losing some See’s Candy business or whatever to some people.

But when we start affecting individuals — most of these are not high-income individuals — and we’re cutting off their livelihood because of something Berkshire is doing, it became — it just became apparent to me that it was unfair to continue it, and reluctantly, we stopped it, and I think it’s too bad.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: We don’t want the parent company involved in distracting arguments about the social issues of the times.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we certainly don’t want it where it affects —

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

WARREN BUFFETT: — people who are just bystanders, basically, who have counted on us over the years to work with them. And it was literally affecting the income of thousands, primarily women, concentrated in certain communities around the country. OK.

CHARLIE MUNGER: A lot of stock — Berkshire stock — is given away every year. It isn’t like we’ve lost the flow of charity totally.

WARREN BUFFETT: No, a huge amount is given away. Partly that’s because Charlie and I started our partnerships back in the 50s and 60s, and we’ve got a number of partners that are now in their 80s, and some of them have given away some exceptional amounts of money.

You had a question earlier from Dick Holland, for example, and Dick Holland — I think it’s a matter of record as to exact numbers — but he’s given away huge amounts of money over the years and continues to.

And we’ve got dozens like that that I would say are going to end up giving back 90 percent or more of all the money they’ve made in Berkshire.

26. Why we hate projections

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. (Applause)

Number 8.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Tanya Laneva (PH), Boston, Massachusetts.

When you think about long-term cash flows, do you try to forecast growth? Or do you just think about certainty?

If you have an indestructible company like Coca-Cola or Burlington Northern, do you try to estimate growth?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we think — are you finished on that?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: We — growth is part of the investment equation, and obviously, we love profitable growth. So we would love to figure out a way to, say, take a See’s Candy, to move it geographically into new areas, all kinds of things.

I mean, if we could find areas for growth with See’s, it would be likely to be very, very profitable.

If Coca-Cola, which is in 200 countries, I mean they have pursued that policy successfully now for 125 years. And some products travel way better than others.

But when we look at a business and we’re looking out in the future, obviously, if we see growth in that picture and it’s growth which is — produces a high return on incremental capital involved, we love it, but we do not rule out companies where we think there will be little or no growth, if the price is attractive relative to the earning power.

You know, there will be some growth, over time, in something like lubricants, you know, at Lubrizol, but it won’t be dramatic growth.

Would we love it if it, you know, if it were going to grow ten percent a year in units or something of the sort? Sure. But that’s not going to happen.

So it’s a factor in every investment decision because we’re really looking out to the future as to future earning power, but also future capital requirements.

And we think plenty about whether any business we go into is likely to grow profitably, and sometimes we’re right and sometimes we’re wrong. But we don’t rule out companies that have very slow growth or no-growth possibilities.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, well, the interesting thing is that in our country, the business schools teach people to make these projections way in the future, and they program these computers to grind these projections out. And then they use them in their business decision making, et cetera, et cetera.

I’ve always regarded those projections as doing more harm than good. And Warren has never prepared one that I know of, and where an investment banker prepares one, we tend to throw them aside without reading them.

WARREN BUFFETT: We them upside down, actually.

CHARLIE MUNGER: What?

WARREN BUFFETT: We turn them upside down.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, yeah. And I think an enormous false precision gets into things when you program computers to make forward projections for a long period of time.

We make rough projections in our head all the time.

WARREN BUFFETT: Sure.

CHARLIE MUNGER: And we don’t do any of those formal projections, because the fact that they’re there on paper and came out of a computer makes some people think they must be significant. I really think they do more damage than they do good.

WARREN BUFFETT: When we bought Scott Fetzer, which was back in about 1985, it had been shopped by First Boston to more than 30 parties. They never got around to calling us.

So after shopping it to about 30 parties, Scott Fetzer, finally, was working on a deal with an ESOP after something else had fallen through, I forget the exact details.

And I sent a letter to Ralph Schey. I’d read about it in the paper. I’d never met him, never talked to the guy. But I sent him a letter.

I figured I’d gamble 21-cents, or whatever the first class rate was then, and I said, “We’ll pay $60 a share. If you like the idea, I’ll meet you in Chicago Sunday, and if you don’t like the idea tear up the letter.”

So that took place and Ralph met me, and we made the deal, and we paid the $60 a share or whatever it was.

And Charlie and I went back to sign up the deal, and the follow from First Boston was there, and he was a little abashed since he had not sent us — contacted us at all — when they were looking for something. But naturally he had a contract that called for a few million dollars of commission even though he’d not bothered to ever contact us and we made the deal by ourselves.

So, in a moment of exuberance while he was collecting his few million dollars, he said to Charlie, he said, “Well, we prepared this book in connection with Scott Fetzer, and since you’re paying us a couple million dollars and have gotten nothing so far,” he said, “maybe you would like to have this book.”

And Charlie, with his usual tact, said I’ll pay you $2 million if you don’t show me the book. (Laughter)

And I should mention, this will — in connection with Lubrizol, Dave Sokol met James Hambrick, I think on whatever it was, January 25, or whatever the date, and he — Lubrizol had already made projections publicly out to 2013.

And Dave told me that they had — they — that James had also given him some projections, I guess out to 2015 or something, and did I want to see them? And I told him no.

I mean, I don’t want to look at the other follow’s projections. I’ve never seen a projection from an investment banker that didn’t show the earnings going up over time, and believe me, the earnings don’t always go up over time.

So, it’s just — you know, it’s the old story: don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut, you know.

You do not want to ask an investment banker what he thinks the earnings are going to be in five years of something he’s trying to sell.

So I pay no attention to that sort of thing.

But we do, as Charlie says, we are doing projections in our head, obviously, when we look at a business. I mean, when we look at any company to buy, or any stock to buy, we are thinking in our mind, we’ve got a model in our mind, of what that place is likely to look like over some period of years. And then we also have some model in our mind of how far off we can be.

I mean there’s some things we can be way off on, there’s other things we’re likely to be in a fairly narrow range on.

So all that is taking place, but we sure don’t want to listen to anybody else’s projections.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Those of you about to enter business school, or who are there, I recommend you learn to do it our way, but at least until you’re out of school you have to pretend to do it their way. (Laughter and applause)

27. Buffett owns a few stocks and lots of bonds

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: On Berkshire’s quarterly 13F filings at the SEC, three stocks are held only by the entity recorded on the form as Warren E. Buffett, and not by a Berkshire subsidiary company.

Please clear up some confusion on this matter. Are these holdings your own personal investments outside of Berkshire, or do they belong to Berkshire Hathaway?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you’ll have to tell me what the names are.

CAROL LOOMIS: Unfortunately, the questioner didn’t include those. But these are the three, I think, that are — that say Warren E. Buffett is the owner.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well, Marc Hamburg prepares those forms. Marc, do you have a microphone that you can — you could —

MARC HAMBURG: I think —

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Go ahead.

MARC HAMBURG: Well, those are securities that are owned by certain employee benefit plans and so that — Warren is directed into those plans, but it doesn’t — they’re not owned by Warren, or there’s no indication that they’re owned by Warren.

Warren is part of the filing because he’s considered to be a controlling shareholder of Berkshire. So every security listed on there shows Warren as one of the — one of the owners.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Do we file stocks owned by pension plans?

MARC HAMBURG: To the extent that you direct — have directed —

WARREN BUFFETT: I got you, yeah.

MARC HAMBURG: Right.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. No, I don’t — I don’t think I — well, Marc knows the rules on it better than I do. I own very, very few securities.

I really spend my time thinking about Berkshire, so I’ve got a lot of the very security I’ve been telling you not to buy, which is government bonds, but that’s not because it’s a good investment. It’s a place to have some money and forget about it, and I’ll work on Berkshire.

28. Evaluating a company outside the U.S.

WARREN BUFFETT: Area 9.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger, it’s an honor and a pleasure. My name is Ben Anderson (PH), I’m from Los Angeles.

When you’re looking at an investment in China, where the business culture is a lot different than it is here in the U.S., and successful business practices are, again, very different than they are here, what are the characteristics you look for when placing investment in that company, and is that any different than the general principles at Berkshire?

WARREN BUFFETT: We follow the same principles, but we recognize that we know less about tax laws, about customs, about attitudes towards shareholders, any time we get outside the United States, than we know in the United States. Now, to varying degrees, we weigh in that uncertainty.

At the time I bought PetroChina stock, which, I don’t know, was probably 2003 or thereabouts, it was extraordinarily cheap, in relation to any calculation of reserves or refining capacity or cash flow or you name it. And at the same time, Yukos in Russia was similarly very, very cheap, and they were both huge.

And I’m no geopolitical expert or anything of the sort, but I decided I was more comfortable buying PetroChina than I was buying Yukos. Now, was I as comfortable buying PetroChina as I would have been buying, you know, some domestic company of similar size?

No, because I don’t know as much — I didn’t know then, and I don’t know as much now, about all the intricacies of Chinese tax law and what the policies might be.

But I was fairly impressed — quite impressed — when I read the report of PetroChina.

For one thing, they said they were going to pay out 45 percent of — as I remember — 45 percent of their earnings in dividends. That’s more than any company — oil company — in the United States would tell me.

So I regarded it as a plus and an indication of intent that I thought would be fulfilled, and it has been fulfilled.

So we do make allowances for our lack of understanding, as well as we might in the United States, various key factors.

But the basic principles of trying to value the business, trying to find managements in which we have confidence, in both their ability and integrity, and then finding attractive purchase price, those principles apply wherever in the world we would be investing.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, we make so few investments in China that trying to draw general lessons from us would be hard.

It reminds me of the time a professor went west for the summer and came back to his faculty and he said, “I’ve learned that Indians always walk single file.” And they said, “How did you figure that out?” And he said, “I saw one and he did.” (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: How did we get from there to China? (Laughter)

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, we only had a couple of things in China. They’re like the one Indian. You can’t draw general lessons from them.

WARREN BUFFETT: But we’re willing to look tomorrow.

I mean, obviously, if we had a call on some — that could be a significant size investment because we — it just doesn’t make any sense for us to look at things we can just put a couple of hundred million dollars in — but we, you know, I love the idea of looking at various ideas.

I mean, I find it a fascinating game to hear about companies or businesses that are new to me. And the problem now is that the universe has gotten much smaller because of our size. But we welcome a call from a lot of countries.

There’s some countries that are just too small. They’re not going to have businesses that could move the needle at a place like Berkshire, and so those are off the list, but —

CHARLIE MUNGER: China has at least one private company that makes over $3 billion a year after taxes. There’s some big things out there.

WARREN BUFFETT: I’ll get the name from him later, but I don’t want you to hear. (Laughter)

29. Where Berkshire’s short-term cash goes

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This question comes from Ed Schmidt (PH) in Alaska. He’s asking about Berkshire’s cash.

He writes, “Where is that money held? All in Treasury bills or notes? If so, what will happen in June when the biggest buyer, the Fed, quits buying? Where is all that money on the sidelines? Is it under the mattress we saw two years ago?

“I don’t see how any significant amount of money can be in banks that aren’t paying interest, corporate bonds that are risky and not paying much interest, or government bonds that seem less and less sound as each day passes.”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, he’s certainly right that all of the choices are lousy for short-term money now, but we don’t play around with short-term money. So we did not own commercial paper in 2008 before problems occurred. We did not own money market funds.

When I say we didn’t own them, maybe small amounts at various subsidiaries, but in terms of the big money, which we run out of Berkshire, we basically keep it in Treasurys.

And we get paid virtually nothing now for it, and that’s irritating, but the last thing in the world we would do at Berkshire is to try and get 5 or 10 or 20 or 30 basis points more by going into some other things with our short-term money.

It is a parking place. It’s an unattractive parking place, but it’s a parking place where we know we’ll get our car back when we want it.

You know, when we need — certainly the case — in September of 2008, we had committed for some time to put $6.5 billion in Wrigley when the Mars/Wrigley deal occurred, and we certainly didn’t contemplate at the time we made that commitment, which was probably in the summer, that the events would take place like they did in September and — but we had the money.

I knew I had to show up with 6 1/2 billion dollars — I think it was on October 6 — and, you know, I had to show up. (Laughs)

I couldn’t show up with a money market fund or some commercial paper or anything of the sort. I had to show up with cash.

And the only thing I feel — virtually the only thing I feel good about, in terms of having large amounts of ready cash is Treasury bills, and that’s where we’ve got — if you look at our March 31st statement, I think you’ll see 38 billion, and overwhelmingly that will be in Treasurys.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, of course, I’ve watched a lot of people struggle who thought it was their duty in life to get an extra 10 basis points on the short-term money.

I think it’s really stupid to try and maximize returns on short-term money if you’re in an opportunist game the way we are, where we want to suddenly deploy money.

Some of those pipelines we bought, they came for sale on Saturday, and we had to close on Monday or something?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Why fool around with some dubious instrument when we had sudden needs for money like that?

WARREN BUFFETT: We bought one pipeline where the seller was worried about going bankrupt the following week. And there’s a Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance required through the FTC, and they needed the money right away, and we — I wrote a letter, as I remember, to the FTC, and I said that we will do whatever you tell us to do later on.

You can look at this all you want. We’ll give you all the data you want. And if you tell us, you know, to unwind the deal, whatever you tell us, we will do.

But these guys need the money, and so we closed it earlier. And our ability to come up with cash when people need it and when the rest of the world is petrified for some reason, has enabled several deals to get done.

We don’t know whether — that could happen tomorrow. I mean, if — you know, Ben Bernanke runs off to South America with Paris Hilton or something — (laughter) —I mean, who knows what will happen. And we want to be able, at that moment, to have our check clear.

So, we figure we never know what tomorrow will bring, although it won’t bring that, I want to — leave that off the transcribed part of the report. (Laughter)

But we are — when somebody comes to us and they say, we need a deal right now, we can do it, and they know we can do it, and it can be big. It just has to be attractive.

30. Wind power needs government subsidies

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Area 10.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Warren. Hi, Charlie. Thank you very much for taking the time to have a terrific shareholders meeting.

Four years ago we announced that we’re naming our son after you, so we’re happy to say hi to both you and Charlie.

Charlie, since Berkshire bought Wesco, we wanted to see if you can take some time to host a meeting of your own? It can be anywhere, anytime.

CHARLIE MUNGER: We’re going to do that.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Great.

CHARLIE MUNGER: We won’t call it a Wesco meeting. We’ll call it, “An Afternoon with Charlie.”

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Great.

CHARLIE MUNGER: It’s only for hard-core addicts. (Laughter)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Warren, MidAmerican Energy is investing over a billion dollars in wind power. How do you feel about wind power as a source of renewable energy and its economics? Will this scale of investment continue and what type of returns do you expect to come from wind power?

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, it’s terrific, but wind power is terrific, but only when the wind blows. And the wind blows about — as I remember— about 35 percent of the time in Iowa.

So you never can count on wind power, obviously, for your base load. And, you know, that is a real limitation.

On the other hand, wind power, you know, is basically, I guess, the cleanest energy you can come up with, except for the fact that it can’t be relied on. It — the economics only make sense with an incentive credit — tax credit — provided by the federal government, which they’ve been doing for a considerable period of time.

It does not — standing on their own, the investment will not return anything like an adequate return on capital. So there is a tax credit that your government has made a decision that it wants to subsidize, in effect, wind power.

And Iowa has been — Iowa is a good wind state. This whole central belt is good and — central part of the country is good — so it’s made sense to locate a lot of megawatts of generating capacity in Iowa, and we have more under construction now, and I think we’re now, I think, number one in the country in respect to wind power.

So we’ll be doing more. It is dependent, in terms of the price you can get, the percentage of the time that you’re generating capacities actually get used and everything, it only makes sense with the tax credits.

And one thing that is kind of interesting — one of the assets of Berkshire is that it pays a lot of taxes. That doesn’t sound like much of an asset, but in these days, a lot of utilities, when you get both a hundred percent depreciation, which has been put in now by the federal government for a short period of time, and you get these sort of tax credits on wind, they really don’t have the tax paying capacity to be able to use the tax credits.

So they are in a different position than Berkshire, which pays a lot of taxes. We’ve probably paid something like 2 percent of all the corporate taxes in the United States, maybe, over the last five years. I want to check that, but it’s not — I don’t think that’s way off.

So we have a lot of tax paying capacity. We can use it to build more wind projects. And I think it’s very likely we will continue to do it.

It helps our Iowa customers. Because these projects are successful, it’s enabled us to keep rates — among other reasons — it’s helped to keep rates absolutely unchanged now for more than a decade, which is very unusual among electric utilities in the United States.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: No, I’ve got nothing to add.

31. We would not have let NetJets go bankrupt

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Well, this is not a David Sokol question, but it relates to him. It’s actually a NetJets question.

This shareholder asked, “I was struck by your statement when you praised Sokol for, quote, ‘having resurrected an operation that was destined for bankruptcy.’

“This really got my attention because I don’t recall you or Berkshire Hathaway saying earlier that NetJets was on the verge of bankruptcy at the time that his predecessor, Richard Santulli, had stepped down.

“In fact, at the time, the company seemed to give the impression it was dealing with a few short-term problems but that it was fundamentally sound. In truth, how close was it to bankruptcy? And if that was the case, why didn’t you tell us?

“And finally, was it ethical for NetJets to be asking perspective clients to part with their money at a time when it was, in the eyes of its main shareholder, quote, ‘destined for bankruptcy?’”

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I think I said it was — maybe we can find the exact words here — but I think I said it was destined for bankruptcy, absent the fact that Berkshire Hathaway owned it, if it had been a standalone entity.

And Berkshire never had any intent, never would have had any intent of any kind, to bankrupt NetJets.

But if it had been owned as a standalone by somebody else, the public, that’s what would have happened to it.

With Berkshire’s ownership, Berkshire has had two insurance companies that would have gone bankrupt as standalone insurance companies. And we — it never crossed our mind that we would let them do it.

So we put money into companies that were bankrupt that Berkshire owned to make them whole, basically. And, essentially, we were doing the same thing with NetJets when we put in — we got it up to 1.9 billion.

But NetJets, in my opinion — well, it would have been bankrupt, absent somebody like Berkshire owning it. I’m almost positive that I said that, that absent Berkshire’s ownership, or some words to that effect — let’s see if I can find it.

Maybe Charlie can be commenting while I’m looking for this.

In any event — (Laughter)

Well, I’m not finding it immediately where I even discussed it, but I know I talked about it on the bankruptcy thing, but I also know that I conditioned it on not being owned by Berkshire.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: No comment.

WARREN BUFFETT: No comment. (Laughter)

We’ve pointed that out to Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. We look at — Berkshire has a lot of different companies, but we feel that it’s one entity and, you know, Moody’s or Standard and Poor’s has to look at each one separately and all of that, but Charlie and I did not — have not been running this business to walk away from some company.

We had one in Louisiana, Southern Casualty, and we had another one in Chicago, both of which, if left to their own devices, would have gone bankrupt, and we didn’t even think about not making them whole.

32. Buffett’s advice: invest in your own skills

WARREN BUFFETT: Area 11?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon. My name is Christopher David (PH). I’m an entrepreneur from Arlington, Virginia. My question is about the youth.

I work with a lot of high school and college students and recent graduates who are facing a job market with 20 percent youth unemployment, and at the same time one of the most favorable entrepreneurial environments. It’s easier than ever to start a business or get involved with a startup.

So considering that these kids are politically savvy, they like studying economics, they’re brilliant and they’re willing to learn, what advice can you give them from an investment perspective that could help them chart their own course, as opposed to get a nine-to-five job?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, the main thing you could do — and people do it different ways. I used to do it by doing a lot of reading — I was — practically lived at the Omaha Public Library for three or four years in pre- — when I was 9 or 10 or 11.

I mean, anything you do to improve your own skills, you know, you never know where it’s going to pay off later on.

I only — I have one diploma hanging in my office, and I got a couple of others, but the one diploma I have hanging up there is one I got from a Dale Carnegie course, which cost me a hundred bucks back in 1951, and I can’t — it’s incalculable how much value I got from that hundred dollars.

There’s nothing like working to improve your own skills, and I would say communications skills are the first area I would work on to enhance your value throughout life, no matter what you do.

I mean, if I had stayed in the same position I was in, in terms of communicating, back in 1950 or ’51, my life would have turned out differently. I mean, I started selling securities. If you can’t talk to people, you’ve got a real problem selling securities.

The — so I — you know, I think people — I think the — if you get lucky, you find your passion early on, but you want to work at something you’re passionate about, and then you want to work to improve your skills in that. And I think if you do both of those things, I think you’re likely to do very well.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, I think economics is a really tough subject, and I think it’s easy to teach the basic microeconomics and certain of the basic ideas, but the minute it gets into the full range of complexity, you have the difficulty that the experts disagree.

So, I don’t think I would hurry if I were trying to learn something into the parts of the fields where none of the experts can agree among themselves. I would master the easy stuff first.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I don’t think — yeah, I would not advise taking lots of courses in economics to somebody going to school.

I’m just trying to think back. It’s been a long time since I took my economics courses at Wharton, but I don’t regard them as the ones that pushed me forward in any significant way.

33. Reinsurance is a lot harder than it looks

WARREN BUFFETT: Carol?

CAROL LOOMIS: Question from Jon Brandt. Does Berkshire’s equity ownership in Munich and Swiss Re reduce the amount of catastrophe-exposed insurance business you are willing to write directly?

If so, assume that prices return to being attractive, would you then limit the quantity of other reinsurance stocks you buy so that you could do more direct business?

WARREN BUFFETT: We have invested in Munich and Swiss Re less than — well, let’s see what it would be — it’s less than $4 billion, so we’re talking 2 1/2 percent of our net worth.

So those investments, in aggregate, are not of a magnitude that would cause me to change at all what we’re willing to do — the risks we’re willing to bear — in the reinsurance field.

We’re way below, sort of, capacity, in terms of risk that we will tolerate in insurance. I mean, I put in the report, you know, I expect our normal earning power to be in the $17 billion or something pretax range.

Well, that is so unlike any other reinsurance company in the world. We went through the worst quarter in reinsurance history, except for Katrina’s quarter, you know, and we end up earning, you know, very substantial sums.

So those investments are no constraint at all on our willingness to write insurance. We would love to have a lot more attractive reinsurance business on the books, we just — we just can’t find it at prices that we think are commensurate for the risk. But it’s not because of an aversion to risk overall.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it’s — insurance, and particularly reinsurance, it’s not that easy a business. It’s taken you a long time to do as well as you do. And if it weren’t for Ajit, why, we wouldn’t — we’d be a lot smaller business.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it should be pointed out, we really didn’t succeed at all in the reinsurance business in the first 15 years.

We started in reinsurance around 1970, and we had a fellow that I thought the world of running it, George Young, but net, counting the value of float, it was not a good business for us for 15 years until Ajit came along. It is not an easy business. It looks easy most of the time. I mean —

CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s the trouble with it. It looks easier than it is.

WARREN BUFFETT: It looks way easier than it is.

And, you know, it’s like having a pair of dice, and, you know, accepting bets on boxcars or something like that, and, you know, it’s going to come up once in 36 times, so you can win a lot of bets by giving the wrong odds, but if you keep do it long enough, you lose a lot of money.

So these infrequent events, you better have factored in to your pricing, and not fool yourself by whether you make money in a given year or two years or even three or four years. And most people have a little trouble with that, and we had a little trouble with it for about 15 years.

CHARLIE MUNGER: And incidentally, the investment bankers of the world, now that they trade so much for their own account and derivatives, they have sold some of these products where most of the time the customer wins but when the customer loses, he really loses big.

In other words, they’re smarter than the customers, and they have caused some of the most horrendous losses to ordinary businessmen. It happened in Korea, it happened in Mexico, it happened —

Just beware of the salesman who’s selling a new derivative product.

WARREN BUFFETT: Or an old one. An old one, too.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, but new ones are worse.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

34. How Buffett first met Todd Combs

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Area 12.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, my name is Bottle Pondy (PH). I’m from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Question’s about Todd Combs, the young money manager you hired late last year.

For Mr. Munger, I understand you introduced him to Berkshire. Could you talk a little bit about that — how that relationship started, and how we as shareholders, are we going to be able to assess his progress?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I hate doing this because I may get more letters than I want, but he sent me a letter. That’s how it happened. It was like Warren’s letter to the guy at — Ralph Schey.

And at any rate, I had a meal with him, and then I called Warren and I said, “I think this is the guy you should talk to.” We have a very complicated business and very elaborate procedures, as you can tell. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: And his results will be known over a five-year period or something. I mean, you cannot judge an investor by what they do in six months or a year.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Todd has the advantage that he’s been thinking about financial companies like Berkshire for a great many years. That’s useful for us to have around.

WARREN BUFFETT: And as we put in the annual report, it’s more likely than not, but not a sure thing, that over time, we have more than one investment manager.

You know, there’s a lot of money at Berkshire to be managed. And it would not be a bad idea, but we have to find the right people, and the right people just does not mean a given IQ or a given past record, it means a lot of things.

And if we end up with two or three, you know, that — that’s a plus. But it’s not — we don’t mandate that sort of a result.

35. Acquisitions and stock

WARREN BUFFETT: Becky?

BECKY QUICK: This question comes in from Scott Wilkin, and he’s from Chicago, but he’s sitting in the audience right now.

Johnson & Johnson is one of Berkshire’s biggest holdings, and he asks for your thoughts, Warren, on Johnson & Johnson’s recent acquisition of Synthes for $21 billion.

You were quite outspoken in your opposition of Kraft’s deal for Cadbury, particularly because of their use of stock. J&J’s deal also is primarily with stock, and do you support this deal?

WARREN BUFFETT: I have not talked to anybody in the Johnson & Johnson management, and I have no specific knowledge of the company, but basically, I would like the deal a whole lot better if it was all for cash.

The idea — when a management trades away — I think this deal is about two-thirds stock, roughly, and one-third cash. And Johnson & Johnson has plenty of ability to pay cash for a $22 billion deal. And when they trade away their present businesses for some other business, they’re either saying their own businesses are pretty fully valued, or they’re saying the guy is making a hell of a mistake that’s selling to them.

So I would — like I say, if it was all for cash, I would like it a lot better. And I think that it is — by using a lot of stock for a deal like this, that it certainly — you can — you can draw the inference that J&J is not valuing its own businesses, you know, as attractively as you might think they should be evaluated.

And if you use your own company stock to pay 20 percent or more than market for some other company and, you know, there probably are not a lot of synergies involved or anything in the management. There may be some, but there’s usually some offsets too.

But like I said, I would have much preferred it if they’d done it for cash.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, you also have the disadvantage in (inaudible) that you know a hell of a lot more about chocolate and pizza than you know about medical devices.

WARREN BUFFETT: You think I know more about chocolate?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, you — (Laughter)

But at Kraft, I mean, you’re talking about businesses that Warren knew a lot about, and neither of us knows much about medical devices.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, the pizza has business has done pretty well since it was sold by Kraft. (Laughs)

36. Why we won’t issue stock to make an acquisition

WARREN BUFFETT: We go to 13 in the other room.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, I’m Glenn Tongue from New York. First off, thank you for a terrific day.

My question deals with acquisitions. Pre-Lubrizol, we estimated Berkshire’s year-end 2011 cash balance could approach $60 billion.

I believe you commented recently on an elephant that you thought was too big.

What is your acquisition appetite? What size is too big? Has the phone been ringing lately? And what if anything can we, as shareholders, do to help?

WARREN BUFFETT: I got through college answering fewer questions than that. But the — (Laughter)

But anything you can do to help, I appreciate, Glenn.

The — you know, it’s hard to name a precise figure. This one, you know, was way too big unless we used a lot of stock, which, like I say, we wouldn’t do.

Our appetite is always there. We are not going to borrow a lot of money. We’re not going to issue shares, except perhaps in some minor amount to make a deal that couldn’t get made otherwise.

But — and, obviously, we’ll never sell a business to buy some other business. So, you know, our cash balances will tend to build month to month unless we do something.

And we can, and will, sell some portfolio securities. But doing Lubrizol requires close to $9 billion of cash, and obviously we could do another one of that size.

In fact, we’re looking at a couple, but they’re no more than a gleam in the eye, but they would take sums roughly similar to Lubrizol, and, you know, we would be comfortable doing those, and they would add significant — significantly to Berkshire’s earning power. They’re worth doing.

But we can’t do a really — a really big elephant now, and we won’t — you know, we won’t stretch. We never — we’ve never really taken any risks because we don’t need to, and we will not trade something that we have and need for something that we don’t have and don’t need, even if we’d kind of like to have it.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I certainly agree with all that.

We are very reluctant to issue shares. And in that, we’re different from most places.

I have a friend that sold out to a socialist country, and they issued shares in a controlled corporation, and the socialist executive said, “Isn’t this wonderful we’re getting this business for nothing.”

WARREN BUFFETT: Some people really have that, and, of course, there are some companies — and we talked about the wave that took place in the late ’60s, but periodically — one certainly happened during the internet period — companies just couldn’t issue shares fast enough, because they basically were trading confetti for real assets. And that is a business model that has been applied successfully for some periods of time by certain companies in the past.

It usually ends in some kind of a fiasco, but — well, I shouldn’t say it usually does, but it runs out of gas at some point.

But, you know, essentially, we’ve never been in that game.

We hate issuing shares and the idea of selling our — when we issue shares we’re divesting ourselves of a portion of every wonderful business we have, from GEICO to ISCAR to you name it. And we don’t like doing that. We like owning those businesses. We’d like to own more of them.

We — you know, we have a deal, for example, on Marmon where we bought some more of it this year, and we will buy the rest of it a few more years, and we feel good about that. We pay a fair price for it, but we get a business we know, a management we like, and that’s really what we’d like to continue doing at Berkshire. In fact, we will continue doing it.

37. Housing market is terrible, but we’ll profit on the rebound

WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew?

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: This question comes from Larry Pitkowsky, who is a long-time shareholder, I think he’s in the audience, from the GoodHaven Fund.

He asks, “Over the years, you built or acquired a significant number of businesses that are related to the residential and commercial real estate markets, including such segments as brokerage servicing, insulation, carpeting, construction products, painted furniture.

“Berkshire’s ownership with these businesses would seem to give you a unique window through which to view current conditions. Could you give us some insight into the current state of the housing and commercial real estate market and what we might expect to see in these businesses over” — and this might be a long shot — “over the next decade.”

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, the immediate situation is it’s terrible. It’s been flatlined now for a long time, and it affects Shaw, it affects MiTek, it affects Acme Brick, it affects Johns Manville, it affects our HomeServices operation.

And there has been no bounce, at all, but you see that in the housing start figures, too.

I’m not telling you anything you don’t see, except I see it with pain as I look at the monthly earnings figures.

But those are good businesses. And as I mentioned in the annual report, we bought the largest brick operation in Alabama. And I think Alabama uses more brick per capita than any state in the union, but that doesn’t mean much currently, because nobody is using any brick to speak of.

But we bought it. We wrote a check for cash, and we like improving our position.

MiTek has bought operations. Shaw is spending a couple hundred million dollars this year, partly because of a change in the nature of the carpet business.

This country, over time, will build houses at a rate, overall, in total, commensurate with household growth, and I think we’re going to see plenty of household growth in future decades, and I think that our companies are well-positioned to make significant money when we get to a normalized level of home building.

I said in the annual report I thought it would — we would be seeing the upswing by year-end. I’ve seen nothing since I wrote the annual report that makes it look like I’m certain to be correct or anything, that there’s been no movement that I’ve seen so far in the two months since I wrote the report.

I would think it would start occurring by then, but if it doesn’t, you know, it may be a year later. I don’t think anybody knows the answer on that.

If I had to bet one way or another, though, I think it will be turning up by year-end.

It really isn’t that important to us. When I made the decision to buy the brick company in Alabama, it was not because I thought brick was going to turn in two months or six months or a year.

I thought that over time, being a very important brick manufacturer and distributor in Alabama adjacent to our strong operation in Texas, it would be a good investment at the price that we paid. And I feel good about the decision, but I won’t feel good about our brick results in the next six months. I can be sure of that.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, one advantage of buying these very cyclical businesses is a lot of people don’t like them. And what difference does it make to us if the earnings average, say, 300 million a year, if it comes in in a very lumpy fashion?

In the big scheme of things, what do we care if it’s lumpy, as long as it’s a good business? And we have an advantage on that stuff. Nobody else was bidding for a brick plant in Alabama with no customers to speak of. (Laughter)

WARREN BUFFETT: We’ll be there if you need brick in Alabama. (Laughter)

You know, See’s Candy, a wonderful business, loses money roughly eight months of the year.

Now, it just so happens we know the seasonal pattern, so we don’t worry in July that somehow Christmas won’t come, you know. We’ve got a couple thousand years on our side. (Laughter)

So the — but that’s — you know, that’s easy to see. If you just looked at one month of See’s earnings or looked at one quarter, you’d think, what are these guys doing in this business?

Now, obviously, cyclical businesses, you know, are not going to behave exactly the same as seasonal businesses, but why look at it any differently?

I mean, if you take the next 20 years, there will be, you know, three or four terrible years for residential housing, and there will be a lot of them that are pretty good, and there will be a few that are terrific.

And I don’t know the order in which they’re going to appear, but I know if I can buy the assets cheap enough to participate in those 20 years, that we’ll do OK over that time. So that’s why we’re in the brick business.

38. Short adjournment before formal business meeting

WARREN BUFFETT: Now let’s see. Yeah, we’re at 3:30, so we will adjourn for about five minutes, and then we will conduct the business meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, and we can turn the lights up, and we’ll rejoin you in just a couple of minutes. (Applause)

39. Berkshire formal annual meeting begins

WARREN BUFFETT: OK. If you’ll settle down, we’ll conduct a little business.

43. Shareholder motion on reduction of greenhouse gases

WARREN BUFFETT: The next item of business is a motion put forth by Miss Coward, a Berkshire shareholder represented by Mr. Bruce Herbert and Mr. Larry Dorrs (PH).

The motion is set forth in the proxy statement.

The motion requests Berkshire Hathaway to establish goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas at its subsidiaries’ power plants, and prepare a report for shareholders on how it will achieve these goals.

The directors recommend that the shareholders vote against the proposal.

I will now recognize Mr. Herbert to present the motion. To allow all interested shareholders to present their views, I ask Mr. Herbert to limit his remarks to five minutes.

The microphone at, well, let’s have Mr. Herbert first, if we can turn up the lights.

BRUCE HERBERT: Thank you.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Bruce Herbert and I’m chief executive of Newground Social Investment in Seattle, Washington.

It is such a pleasure to be here today, representing a life-long owner of Berkshire Class A shares. And I stand to present the resolution found on page 12 of the proxy, that asks our company to set goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at its energy holdings.

This is because serious investors know, and studies show, that climate change creates financial liability.

The Investor Network on Climate Risk, whose members manage more than $10 trillion, and the Carbon Disclosure Project, representing more than $70 trillion in assets globally, call on companies to disclose risks related to climate change, as well as the actions taken to mitigate those risks.

In 2010, 66 percent of U.S. electric utilities had already set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. Sixty-six percent. Unfortunately, Berkshire MidAmerican was not among them.

Now, investors have cause to be concerned. Just last year, the SEC announced that climate risks are material, and that they must be disclosed.

We do applaud MidAmerican for having the largest wind energy portfolio of any utility in the United States.

However, it is also true that MidAmerican generates close to three-quarters of its power burning coal. Investors, globally, want to reduce risk through cleaner generation, and 66 percent of public utilities have already published their plans for doing so.

But MidAmerican offers no such plan, despite the public proclamation via its website, that, quote, “We will set challenging goals and assess our ability to continually improve our environmental performance,” unquote.

There is no more important environmental goal for a coal-burning utility than to reduce pollution. But more than this, Berkshire is uniquely vulnerable, in that the financial burdens of climate change are pushed onto insurance companies, and as a major insurer, this has serious financial ramifications for our company.

Berkshire enjoys a remarkable and well-earned reputation, earned over many decades, for being practical visionaries. Addressing climate change offers an opportunity for our company both to uphold and to enhance this reputation.

So in closing, the world’s largest institutional investors call on companies to set greenhouse gas reduction goals. Such goals are key tools for managing the extraordinary business risk of climate change.

Two-thirds of utilities in the United States have already set these types of reduction goals, and this resolution, importantly, gives Berkshire managers the freedom to determine what those goals should be and to shape the process for meeting them.

And the major proxy advisory firms have repeatedly recommended voting for similar resolutions.

So I will close with a request and a question. The request is for all of you here to please join us in supporting this common sense proposal.

And the question, gentlemen, is, have you evaluated the business risk of climate change to our companies and what did you find out? Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you, Mr. Herbert.

We have a microphone at zone 1. It’s available for anyone wishing to speak for or against the motion. You’ve seen where zone 1 is there.

I’ll wait just a minute or two in case anybody would like — is there an additional speaker there that —?

I’ll ask that, for the benefit of those present, I ask that each speaker for or against the motion limit themselves to two minutes and confine your remarks solely to the motion.

So go ahead.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, I’m Paul Herman, founder of HIP Investor. HIP stands for Human Impact and Profit. We’re a registered investment advisor in the states of California, Illinois, and Washington.

Climate change is obviously one of the risks to Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate companies, including MidAmerican Energy and Burlington — the Burlington railway — which transports coal, much of which is getting exported to China.

So we are concerned about, also, about the disclosure, quantification, and impact on profit, of greenhouse gases, as well as the quantification of the asset of the carbon credits that might be available for eco-efficient companies.

So we strongly support this resolution for increased disclosure, increased transparency and evaluation of the financial returns that are possible, or the financial liabilities, especially with your expertise in reinsurance, because reinsurance companies typically put a quantification of potential carbon exposure and liabilities, whereas traditional insurance companies may not do so.

So we strongly advocate for transparency, disclosure, and quantification as to the potential risks and liabilities. The SEC has encouraged this type of disclosure, though they have not mandated it. So Berkshire Hathaway would be a leader in doing this, as companies like GE, which their Ecomagination initiative, the 10 percent of revenue that they generate from their Ecomagination products, and other leaders from Jeff Immelt to the leaders of Duke Power that take a positive position on the financial returns that are possible for addressing climate change and carbon efficiency. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you.

We have some more speakers there?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger. My name is Jefferson Lilly (PH), a long-term Berkshire shareholder. It’s my personal opinion that it’s the previous two speakers that are the hot air in the problem around global warming, and that we — (applause) — that we not regulate Berkshire Hathaway to force it to have carbon disclosure or other silly rules.

It’s fine if the managers of the individual businesses choose to do that on their own, but it’s completely inappropriate to bring this false religion of global warming to try and regulate Berkshire Hathaway.

You guys are doing a great job on your own. (Applause)

WARREN BUFFETT: Are there any other speakers there that —?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Munger and Warren Buffett. I would just like to say one thing, which I think is really important.

Berkshire Hathaway can be a leader in the environment. And I’m for transparency, as I know these two gentlemen are, and John Doerr, who is very passionate about the environment, and I know if he was here today, he would have the same sentiments as these two gentlemen.

And it’s important that as American citizens, we care about the environment. And not keep polluting the environment. And I’m with these two gentlemen 100 percent.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Applause)

Do we have any others that haven’t spoken?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. My name is Eric Shlime (PH). I am not for this, so against the motion.

I think Berkshire Hathaway has a pretty good reputation at being clean, being environmentally responsible. I don’t think anyone is saying that either Mr. Buffett or Mr. Munger is somehow — doesn’t care about the environment.

I think most people care about the environment. But it doesn’t mean that we should for Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, or any of the CEOs, to tell them how to run their business.

You guys care a lot about Berkshire’s reputation. If Berkshire’s subsidiaries are just polluting oceans and ponds and destroying the reputation in different towns and cities, I don’t think that would be too cool with either Buffett or Munger.

So, doesn’t mean you don’t care about the environment just because you’re not going to somehow regulate and tell other people how to run their business. Let’s just do things voluntarily, do things to make money, and be responsible. At the end of the day, that’s what wins. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Applause)

Anyone additional?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, my name’s Larry Dorrs (PH) and I support this resolution.

I don’t think anybody is saying anything other than you’re gentlemen of great integrity. But this is a dollars and cents issue. And the EPA is releasing new rules that are calling for more regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.

So this — you know, we’re really approaching this from a point of view of a conglomerate that has insurance holdings, and it really is insurance companies that are bearing the great costs.

So I’m looking very much forward to your point of view on this. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you.

Anyone else?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, thank you. David Hughes (PH), a shareholder.

It’s my opinion that this is the right thing to do and I think that it makes sense to do it, as an organization, prior to being forced to do it.

And if this gives you the tools to set the rules your way, as you see fit, then I think that’s far more powerful and sets a precedent, as Berkshire has done in the past, so I am for the resolution.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

Anyone additional?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. My name is Thomas Dankenburter (PH) and my background was in biochemistry, and I’m very passionate about the environment, and I think it’s very important for Berkshire to work to be a leader, and so I’m very much in support of this proposition.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

Got somebody else there?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. My name is Sarah Cleveland. I’m from Portland, Oregon.

I want to just also put a voice in favor of this resolution, and I think it’s not about rights or wrong. It’s about a willingness to take a look at risks and opportunities. And also for Berkshire Hathaway to be a leader. And also work with the subsidiary companies on specific possibilities.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

WARREN BUFFETT: You’re on.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Sam Roy (PH). This is my first meeting.

Mr. Munger and Warren Buffett, I’m so impressed how you run your business, but I think you will care for the environment as well. I don’t know whether we should impose a route, but at least you will, by your act, how the local businesses are run, and all the operating goes out and appears, and there is no question that we do everything possibly that we never pollute the air that cannot be changed.

It is not hot air, but it is something I’m very passionate about. You can do anything with your environmental, but if you are not taking charge right now, we don’t know what the implications would be for our kids and grandkids.

I request you give it total investigation, and I think you will do that. Thank you for this opportunity.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, my name is Bob Stein (PH). I’m a registered, professional engineer, and I have a couple comments, and I’m a Berkshire stockholder.

One, I think we all support very sound environmental protection. But the science before this — that’s being used by EPA for greenhouse gases is not necessarily sound, and is not necessarily in the best interests of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.

Also, everything that the EPA has proposed is not practical and has caused a lot of problems making U.S. competitive in the world industrial market. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Jason Bang (PH), Palo Alto, California. For me, one thing that’s been very interesting about the issue is that it is something that deserves the passion that people bring to it. And I actually side with many of these people on the science of the issue.

What concerns me is, not necessarily that Berkshire agrees to the motion, I’m actually against it, but that the enterprises under Berkshire are about to help evangelize the true science behind what’s actually going on and help the American public get a better understanding, so they can also bring about change, rather than have it all occur from the executive level.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon. My name is Bill Guenther. I’m a shareholder from Newfane, Vermont.

I work as a state forester back home and I want to say for folks that don’t believe global warming is reality, I wish you would follow me around in the woods. It definitely is.

I want to support this resolution and I hope that the rest of the shareholders will feel it important enough to see it through. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon. I’m (inaudible). I care about energy. I care about energy and environment more than anybody else because I’m currently still studying energy and environment issues.

But I truly believe the power of private sector, the power of free markets. And I think it’s not your responsibility to put the resources of the shareholder for this issue. It’s not your expertise.

I can personally do a better job to provide (inaudible) to do environmental advocacy than you do. So actually, against this resolution. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sorry, I have a friend to say something. I can translate it.

(OFF-MICROPHONE SPEAKING)

OK. He says the development of the solar panel has great impact on China. And the question — and he also thinks that, actually, Berkshire should do something, as should think about the implication of that.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

OK. Whoops, we have one more.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, I’m Kevin Thompson (PH). I’m a shareholder.

I’m for the motion. I am a career engineer that works with an oil company. And what we found when we started looking at greenhouse gas emissions was that what we thought was going to end up costing the company more money actually created more revenue for the company.

And those are some of the stories that generally don’t get told, but they are out there. And I would recommend that you take a look at it, because in actuality, what you may be dismissing may actually be revenue for your shareholders. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello, Mr. Buffett. I’m Mike from (inaudible) and there’s obviously a fine line between, like, cutting down the Amazon forest and, like, just burning some coal.

So sometimes you can give up a little but you can’t really give up that much. So that’s why I don’t support the motion.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Scattered applause)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: You’re welcome.

MEETING OFFICIAL: There do not appear to be any further comments.

WARREN BUFFETT: OK, thank you. (Applause)

Democracy in action at Berkshire.

The — a couple of questions that were raised. In terms of material information, or material risks, in respect to Berkshire and specifically to our insurance operation, annually in the 10-K, there’s a recitation of risk. And, in my own opinion, in terms of our insurance operation, this question does not pose material risk to Berkshire’s insurance operations.

The question one gentleman, toward the end, mentioned the fact that it might even be more profitable for Berkshire, in terms of what might happen if we followed the motion. Ironically, he could well be right if it were in our determination, but just take our three major states in electric utility operation, where we serve almost two million customers, Iowa, Utah, and Oregon, but it’s true of other states as well.

We operate under the dictates of the utility commissions in those three states, all of which — or each of which — sets their own rules regarding operation, and each of which we end up obeying.

If we were to unilaterally, for example, decide to close down significant coal generation, we would be told to depreciate those plants over a shorter period, and that would translate, not in the cost to Berkshire, it would translate into higher rates for electricity there.

We are entitled to a return on our investment and the faster the depreciation, the higher the rates have to be in order to achieve allowed returns.

So there was a woman from Oregon speaking, for example. And the burden of any unilateral attempt by us — and we couldn’t do it without the approval of the utility commissions — but the burden would fall on customers.

And it is true, actually, that we would recoup accelerated depreciation and we would probably have a much larger investment on which we would be allowed a return in other generating facilities.

But this is a question — this is not something that the stockholders of Berkshire end up incurring the costs of. It’s something that the rate, or the users of electricity in these various states, will pay for. And that judgment, quite properly, should be made by the public utility commissions of those various states. And whatever they decide, you know, we will follow.

And over time, there’s no question, just like we’ve talked about our wind generation in Iowa, this country will move toward a different composition of electricity generation.

And as I stated earlier, I personally favor more nuclear over time, but that will be determined both at the state level, and in some ways, at the national level.

So it’s our recommendation that the motion be voted down. And I think the motion is now ready to be acted upon.

If there are any shareholders voting in person, they should now mark their ballots on the motion and allow the ballot to be delivered to the inspector of elections.

Miss Amick, when you are ready you may give your report?

BECKI AMICK: My report is ready.

The ballot of the proxyholders in response to proxies that were received through last Thursday evening cast 67,733 votes for the motion, and 608,576 votes against the motion.

As the number of votes against the motion exceeds a majority of the number of votes of all Class A and Class B shares outstanding, the motion has failed.

The certification required by Delaware law of the precise count of the votes will be given to the secretary to be placed with the minutes of this meeting.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you, Miss Amick.

The proposal fails.

44. Formal meeting adjourns

WARREN BUFFETT: Does anyone have any further business to come before this meeting before we adjourn?

If not, I recognize Mr. Scott to place a motion before the meeting.

WALTER SCOTT: I move this meeting be adjourned.

WARREN BUFFETT: Is there a second?

VOICE: I second it.

WARREN BUFFETT: A motion to adjourn has been made and seconded. We will vote by voice.

Is there any discussion? If not, all in favor say aye.

All opposed say no.
