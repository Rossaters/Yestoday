**31. Formal business meeting**

WARREN BUFFETT: We’re going to move it right along — do a little gun-jumping here.

If you’ll please take your seat, thank you.

This is the formal meeting, so the meeting will now come to order.

I’m Warren Buffett, chairman of the board of directors of the company, and I welcome you to this 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.

This morning, I introduced the Berkshire Hathaway directors that are present and also with today are partners in the firm of Deloitte & Touche, our auditors.

Jennifer Tselentis is the assistant secretary of Berkshire Hathaway. She will make a written record of the proceedings.

Becki Amick has been appointed inspector of elections at this meeting, and she will certify to the count of votes cast in the election for directors and the motions to be voted upon at the meeting.

The named proxy holders for this meeting are Walter Scott and Marc Hamburg. Does the assistant secretary have a report of the number of Berkshire shares outstanding entitled to vote and represented at the meeting?

VOICE: This is the important part.

VOICE: You sit there.

WARREN BUFFETT: We’re building the suspense here. (Laughs)

JENNIFER TSELENTIS: Yes, I do. As indicated in the proxy statement that accompanied the notice of this meeting that was sent to all shareholders of record on March 7th, 2018, the record date for this meeting, there were 748,347 shares of Class A Berkshire Hathaway common stock outstanding with each share entitled to one vote on motions considered at the meeting, and 1,344,969,701 shares of Class B Berkshire Hathaway common stock outstanding with each share entitled to 1/10,000th of one vote on motions considered at the meeting.

Of that number, 537,524 Class A shares and 823,145,874 Class B shares are represented at this meeting by proxies returned through Thursday evening May 3rd.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. That number represents a quorum. And we will therefore directly proceed with the meeting.

First order of business will be a reading of the minutes of the last meeting of shareholders. I recognize Mr. Walter Scott who will place a motion before the meeting.

WALTER SCOTT: I move that the reading of the minutes of the last meeting of shareholders be dispensed with and the minutes be approved.

WARREN BUFFETT: Do I hear a second?

RON OLSON: I second the motion.

WARREN BUFFETT: Motion has been moved and seconded. We will vote on this motion by voice vote. All those in favor say aye.

VOICES: Aye.

WARREN BUFFETT: Opposed. The motion is carried.

The next item of business is to elect directors. If a shareholder is present who did not send in a proxy or wishes to withdraw a proxy previously sent in, you may vote in person on the election of directors and other matters to be considered at this meeting. Please identify yourself to one of the meeting officials in the aisles so that you can receive a ballot.

I recognize Mr. Walter Scott to place a motion before the meeting with respect to the election of directors.

WALTER SCOTT: I move that Warren Buffett, Charles Munger, Greg Abel, Howard Buffett, Stephen Burke, Susan Decker, William Gates, David Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman, Ajit Jain, Thomas Murphy, Ron Olson, Walter Scott, and Meryl Witmer be elected as directors.

WARREN BUFFETT: Is there a second?

RON OLSON: I second the motion.

WARREN BUFFETT: It has been moved and seconded that Warren Buffett, Charles Munger, Gregory Abel, Howard Buffett, Stephen Burke, Susan Decker, William Gates, David Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman, Ajit Jain, Thomas Murphy, Ronald Olson, Walter Scott, and Meryl Witmer be elected as directors. Are there any other nominations or any discussion?

The nominations are ready to be acted upon. If there are any shareholders voting in person, they should now mark their ballots on the election of directors and deliver their ballots to one of the meeting officials in the aisles. Miss Amick, when you are ready you may give your report.

BECKI AMICK: My report is ready. The ballot of the proxy holders in response to proxies that were received through last Thursday evening cast not less than 605,906 votes for each nominee. That number exceeds a majority of the number of the total votes of all Class A and Class B shares outstanding. The certification required by Delaware law of the precise count of the votes will be given to the secretary to be placed with the minutes of this meeting.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you, Miss Amick. Warren Buffett, Charles Munger, Gregory Abel, Howard Buffett, Steve Burke, Susan Decker, William Gates, David Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman, Ajit Jain, Thomas Murphy, Ron Olson, Walter Scott, and Meryl Witmer have been elected as directors.

**32. Shareholder motion on methane emissions**

WARREN BUFFETT: The next item of business is a motion put forth by Freeda Cathcart on behalf of shareholder Marcia Sage. The motion is set forth in the proxy statement. The motion requests that the company provide a report revealing the company’s policies, actions, plans, and reduction targets related to methane emissions from all operations.

The directors have recommended that the shareholders vote against the proposal.

I will now recognize Miss Cathcart to present the motion. To allow all interested shareholders their views, I ask that the representative of the Baldwin Brothers limit the presentation of the motion to five minutes.

FREEDA CATHCART: Good morning Chairman Buffett, Mr. Munger, members of the board and fellow shareholders. I am presenting this proposal on behalf of Baldwin Brothers on the issue of methane asset risk. This is the second year for this methane-focused proposal. Last year 10 percent of shareholders approved of it.

Methane asset risk is a serious financial safety and environmental issue across the entire natural gas supply chain. The failure of a gas injection well at Southern California Gas Aliso Canyon Storage facility in Los Angeles revealed major vulnerabilities in the maintenance and safety of natural gas facilities.

In that situation, cleanup and containment costs have soared to close to $1 billion. Governor Jerry Brown of California has threatened to shut down the facility.

Berkshire Hathaway owns the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the United States. It has natural gas storage distribution and transportation facilities that may face similar safety risks through the Northern Natural Gas Company, Kern River Gas, and MidAmerican Energy Corporations.

On an environmental front, research indicates methane leaks could erase the climate benefits of reducing coal use to meet internationally agreed upon climate change targets. Methane emissions have an impact on global temperature of roughly 84 times that of CO2 over a 20-year period.

Berkshire is a voluntary member of the EPA’s Methane Challenge and ONE Future Emissions Intensity Commitment Framework and should be applauded for reducing its leakage rates to below the 1 percent target along its value chain.

Since this framework is a cost-effective versus prescriptive approach, shareholders would like to understand if this cost-effective approach employed at Berkshire is sufficient — maintenance and enhanced disclosure should help mitigate the potential for these financial and regulatory risks.

In closing, we think it prudent that Berkshire Hathaway issue a report revealing and disclosing the company’s specific best practices, policies, and safety standards for methane assets and required upgrade costs to facilities to mitigate potential business risks.

The report would make it easier for investors, customers, and regulators to understand Berkshire’s overall approach to managing methane emissions and risks. Thank you for your consideration.

WARREN BUFFETT: Miss Cathcart, could you help me out? Are there some other people that are there to speak? I can’t quite see from here.

VOICE: No, there are no other shareholders who wish to speak on this issue.

FREEDA CATHCART: There’s nobody behind me to speak.

WARREN BUFFETT: Did you get that, Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: No.

WARREN BUFFETT: Greg — could we put up slide one and then if somebody will give Greg a microphone, that’d be helpful. He could elaborate some on this chart and knows what we’re doing.

GREG ABEL: OK. Thanks, Warren and appreciate the comments there. What we’ve prepared here is in response to the proposal. It demonstrates the ONE Future Initiative goal as it was highlighted. They’d like to see our pipelines operating by 2025 at a 1 percent throughput — or a loss of throughput at 1 percent.

I’m happy to report, as this slide shows, that in 2017 our throughput loss was 0.046 percent, 20 times better than the request in 2025. (Applause)

Thank you. It’s a great compliment to our operating team, obviously. They take the issue that has been highlighted very seriously. I would also add, as it was noted, we’re part of the EPA program where we report on a voluntary basis. Our practices are disclosed and reviewed by the EPA and additionally added on our website.

Accordingly, I strongly feel we’re getting the results and disclosing the appropriate information. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, and thanks Greg. And Miss Cathcart, we are on the same side you are on this basically. We just are not looking for ways to conduct more studies and prepare reports that may cost us money and generate more reports and all that. But I can tell you two things.

This is something that is reported to the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway Energy quarterly. And I’m on that board. And we believe in achieving the same things and we think Berkshire Hathaway Energy is both sensitive and effective — sensitive to and effective — in reducing methane emissions.

So if — I think we’re now ready. The motion is now ready to be acted upon. If there are any shareholders voting in person, they should now mark their ballots on the motion and deliver their ballot to one of the meeting officials in the aisles. Miss Amick, when you’re ready, you may give your report.

BECKI AMICK: My report is ready. The ballot of the proxy holders in response to proxies that were received through last Thursday evening cast 48,040 votes for the motion and 558,640 votes against the motion.

As the number of votes against the motion exceeds a majority of the number of votes of all Class A and Class B shares properly cast on the matter, as well as all votes outstanding, the motion has failed. The certification required by Delaware law of the precise count of the votes will be given to the secretary to be placed with the minutes of this meeting.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you, Miss Amick. The proposal fails.

**33. Shareholder proposal on sustainability reports**

WARREN BUFFETT: The next item of business is a motion put forth by shareholder Freeda Cathcart. The motion is set forth in the proxy statement. The motion requests that Berkshire adopt a policy to encourage more Berkshire subsidiary companies to issue annual sustainability reports.

I will now recognize Freeda Cathcart to present the motion, and to all interested shareholders to present their views I ask her to limit her remarks to five minutes. You have the floor, Miss Cathcart.

FREEDA CATHCART: Thank you so much. It is a privilege to be here and a privilege I can give thanks to my grandfather James Cathcart, who started out in the mailroom of Gen Re and worked himself up through the company to become the chair of Gen Re. During that time he accumulated a lot of Gen Re stock, which he bestowed generously upon his family.

And when he did so, he encouraged the members of his family to do good and to pay it forward, to do something that would make a difference in the world and in our communities. For my father, he did so by being philanthropic with educational institutions with the theory that if you give a person a fish you feed them for a day, but if you teach them to fish, you feed them for a lifetime.

My focus has been on the environment with the thought that when people fish, it would be nice if they were able to eat the fish.

I want to take this opportunity to clarify my proposal about the sustainability reports and put the emphasis on the word encourage. It is evident that Berkshire Hathaway’s management of allowing the subsidiaries to work without getting guidance — well, mandates from you is being very successful.

And I wouldn’t recommend changing it. You’re doing a great job. Please keep it up.

But I do think that there’s something to be said to encourage them and support them, and in many ways you already are.

There is a high level of interest from investors and the public in corporate social responsibility. One-fifth of investments are based on socially responsible investment strategies. And back in 2012, I found an article by Planet Earth Herald where they wrote, “When Warren Buffett talks, people listen. He is now talking about the environment. He believes that companies need to have a triple bottom line. And respecting the environment is absolutely critical to a company’s economic performance.”

In times — and this is a direct quote from you, Mr. Buffett, “In times such as these a company must invest in the key ingredients of profitability: its people, communities, and the environment.”

One-third of Berkshire Hathaway’s subsidiaries already have a sustainability presence on the web. And one of them is Berkshire Energy that has the acronym respect, R-E-S-P-E-C-T, which stands for Responsibility, Efficiency, Stewardship, Performance, Communication, and Training.

And Berkshire Hathaway provides an annual sustainability summit to help bring the subsidiaries together so they can learn how to be more sustainable, how to share tips, and how to be profitable. And that’s excellent.

But when I try to find a web presence about the sustainability summit, I wasn’t able to find it. And that’s where I think that we can do a better job in Berkshire Hathaway when it comes to communication with our shareholders and with the outside world about the good work that we’re doing.

A simple solution to that would just be to create a link on the Berkshire Hathaway website to sustainability that people could click on and go and find out about initiatives like the sustainability summit. And from there, perhaps, they could click on to go to the subsidiaries that have a web presence about sustainability to see what they’re doing.

In doing so, we give a window to the world where they can see what we’re doing to make a difference that might inspire other corporations to follow the example. Or perhaps a college student working on a paper would read about it and think that that is a good business model, that that’s something that he wants to bring forward when he goes into his career.

There is a Facebook page called “Berkshire Hathaway’s Sustainability” that will be available for shareholders and the outside world to look at to see research and to encourage each other to learn how we can support sustainability practices. And that is available now.

I greatly appreciate this opportunity to speak with you today and to clarify what my proposal is. And I do greatly applaud and appreciate all the work that you’re doing on behalf of our corporation and the world. Thank you so much.

WARREN BUFFETT: And thank you. (Applause)

Many of the managers — a great many of the managers — of Berkshire are here and are listening to you. And I suspect that a very high percentage of them agree with what you’re saying. Whether they — what they do in terms of web pages and so on, in our view, is basically up to them.

But I can tell you that one leading proponent, as you mentioned, was Greg Abel, who until recently was running Berkshire Hathaway Energy and now is vice chairman. And Greg may want to say a few words on this, too. But I can assure you that the managers are listening to you.

GREG ABEL: Thanks, Warren. Yeah, we do everything that was touched on. I’ll just maybe add a few points for our shareholders. Obviously, sustainability is a priority for Berkshire and each of our operating subsidiaries. It was highlighted that a number of them have sustainability reports. But I would go beyond that. If you go to our various companies’ websites, you’ll see specific actions they’re taking relative to sustainability. So it may not be summarized in a specific report, but that type of information is available.

I can also add that when you think of the Berkshire Hathaway Energy Corporation, we’re trying to lead by example with support from Warren, Charlie, Walter Scott. I’m happy to report, if you look at where our energy production is right now at the end of 2017, 50 percent of our energy that is produced and consumed by our customers comes from renewable energy.

That’s something we’re strongly communicating across the U.S. and globally as an example of what can be done in our industry. And I’m happy to report by the end of 2021, 100 percent of the energy utilized by our customers can be met through renewable energy in Iowa.

So I understand the concept of sustainability. We’re working across our organizations to share best practices. But as Warren highlighted, it really resides in each of our companies. But it will be encouraged and you’ll continue to see great results. Thank you.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. (Applause)

The motion is now ready to be acted upon. If there are any shareholders voting in person they should now mark their ballot on the motion and deliver their ballot to one of the meeting officials in the aisles.

Miss Amick, when you’re ready you may give your report.

BECKI AMICK: My report is ready. The ballot of the proxy holders in response to proxies that were received through last Thursday evening cast 67,282 votes for the motion and 544,256 votes against the motion.

As the number of votes against the motion exceeds a majority of the number of votes of all Class A and Class B shares properly cast on the matter, as well as all votes outstanding, the motion has failed. The certification required by Delaware law of the precise count of the votes will be given to the secretary to be placed with the minutes of this meeting.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you, Miss Amick. And I would say Miss Cathcart, our managers heard you. I mean, you have had an impact and I appreciate what you have done.

Walter, I guess we’re now ready for a motion?

WALTER SCOTT: I move that this meeting be adjourned.

WARREN BUFFETT: Is there a second?

RON OLSON: I second the motion.
