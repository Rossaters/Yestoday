**BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.

To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: 

致伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司所有股东 

Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have the job of managing a portion of your savings. We are honored by your trust. 

查理·芒格是我的长期合作人，我们的工作是管理你们的一部分资产。我们很荣幸得到你们的信任。

Our position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if we were the absentee owner and you were the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, and through the annual meeting as well. 

出于职责，我们会站在你们的角度，向你们报告你们希望知道的情况，如同我们是缺席股东而你们是CEO。我们喜欢通过这封年度信函以及年会与你们直接沟通。 

Our policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor large institutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order to maximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday. 

我们的原则是平等对待所有股东。因此，我们不与分析师或大型机构进行讨论。此外，只要有可能，我们都会在周六早上发布重要的沟通信息，以最大限度地让股东和媒体在周一市场开盘前有时间消化吸收新闻。

A wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files with the S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 – K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; others will simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire. 

大量的伯克希尔的事实和数据载于公司定期提交给美国SEC的年度10-K报告中。我们在年报中转载了这份报告。一些股东认为这些财务细节令人着迷，而另一些股东则更愿意了解，查理和我所认为的伯克希尔发生的新奇有趣的事情。 

Alas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing the intrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be. 

可惜的是，2021年这种事情几乎没有。不过，我们确实在提高你们的股票内在价值方面取得了合理的进展。57年来，这项任务一直是我的主要职责。未来也一样。 

# What You Own 股东们拥有什么

Berkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second group largely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S. equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities. 

伯克希尔拥有各种各样的业务，有些是完全控股，有些是部分控股。第二类主要是美国重要公司的可交易普通股。此外，我们还拥有一些美国之外的股票，并参与了一些合资企业或其他合作项目。

Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable economic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectations about their long-term business performance and not because we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That point is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers. 

无论我们以怎样的形式拥有一家公司，我们的目标是对具有持久经济优势和一流CEO的企业进行有意义的投资。请特别注意，我们拥有的股票是基于我们对其长期经营业绩的预期，而不是因为想搭市场波动的"顺风车"。这一点很关键。查理和我不是挑选股票的高手，我们是挑选生意的高手。

I make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that are marginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that – on occasion – it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated transactions and never occurs en masse. It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the marketable arena. 

我犯了很多错误。因此，我们收集的多元化业务，包含了少数真正具有非凡经济特征的业务，一些具有良好经济特征的业务、以及一大部分较为普通的业务。我们的普通股投资部分的一个优势是，偶尔地，可以很容易以便宜的价格买到一些优秀的企业。这种"在桶里打鱼"的经历在谈判交易中非常罕见，从未大规模发生过。而且，当我们买卖普通股犯错时，退出也要容易得多。

# Surprise, Surprise 惊讶，惊讶

Here are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors: 

以下是关于你们公司的一些事情，即使是经验丰富的投资者也经常会感到惊讶：

- Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth, Berkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets – classified on our balance sheet as property, plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That supremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact. 
  
  许多人认为伯克希尔是一个庞大的、有点奇怪的金融资产控股集团。事实上，伯克希尔拥有并经营的美国"基础设施"资产(在我们的资产负债表上被归类为财产、厂房和设备)，比任何其他美国公司所拥有和经营的都多。这种巨大规模从来都不是我们的目标，然而，这已经成为事实。 
  
  At yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion. That number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire always will be building. 
  
  截至年底，伯克希尔的资产负债表上所记录的国内基础设施资产价值为1580亿美元。这个数字去年有所增加，并将继续增加。伯克希尔公司将会持续建设它。 

- Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid $3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion. Additionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailable assertion when made by Berkshire shareholders. 
  
  每年伯克希尔都要缴纳大量的联邦所得税。例如，2021年我们缴纳了33亿美元，而美国财政部报告的企业所得税收入总额为4020亿美元。此外，伯克希尔公司还支付大量的州税和外国税。"我已经捐过钱了"对伯克希尔的股东来说，并不是个借口。 
  
  Berkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership between government and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning and Hathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, these venerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination. 
  
  伯克希尔公司的历史生动地说明了政府和美国企业之间无形的、经常被忽视的财务伙伴关系。我们的故事开始于1955年，当时伯克希尔精纺公司和哈撒韦制造公司同意合并其业务。这两家古老的新英格兰纺织公司在请求股东批准的过程中，对合并表示了很高的期望。 
  
  The Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that “The combination of the resources and managements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.” That upbeat view was endorsed by the company’s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, that Lehman Brothers). 
  
  例如，哈撒韦公司的招标书向其股东保证："此次资源和管理的整合将产生纺织业中最强大最有效的公司之一"。这种乐观的观点得到了该公司顾问雷曼兄弟的认可(没错就是金融危机中破产的雷曼兄弟)。
  
  I’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the union was consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholders reaped a disaster. 
  
  我相信，合并完成的那天，Fall River(伯克希尔)和New Bedford(哈撒韦)两地的股东都很快乐。然而，在乐队停止演奏，银行家们回家后，股东们却收获了一场灾难。 
  
  In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from $51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividends and plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating loss as well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered an extended and non-reversible death march. 
  
  在合并后的九年里，伯克希尔的股东眼睁睁地看着公司的净资产从5140万美元降至2210万美元。在一定程度上，这种下降是由股票回购、不明智的分红和工厂关闭造成的。数千名员工9年来的努力也无法挽回经营上的亏损。伯克希尔的挣扎并不罕见：新英格兰的纺织业已经悄悄开始了它漫长的、不可逆转的死亡之旅。 
  
  During the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire’s troubles. All told, the company paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period – a pathetic $100 per day. 
  
  在合并后的9年里，美国财政部也因伯克希尔的问题而受到影响。期间公司只向政府缴纳了337359美元的所得税，平均每天只有可怜的100美元。 
  
  Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and steered essentially all earnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the years. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholders prospered. 
  
  1965年初情况发生了变化。伯克希尔任命了新的管理层，重新调配可用的现金，并把所有的收益都投入到表现良好的业务中，其中大部分业务多年来一直保持良好。收益的再投资与复利的力量相结合，发挥出神奇的魔力，股东们也因此而受益。 
  
  Berkshire’s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their “silent partner,” the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billions of dollars from the company in income tax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 million daily to the Treasury. 
  
  应该指出的是，伯克希尔的股东并不是这一调整的唯一受益者。他们"沉默的合作伙伴"美国财政部，持续从伯克希尔收到了数百亿美元的所得税。还记得之前伯克希尔每天只缴纳100美元的所得税吗？现在，伯克希尔每天向财政部缴纳大约900万美元税款。
  
  In fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge – indeed trumpet – the fact that Berkshire’s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Our country would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home, however, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, say thanks. 
  
  为了对我们的政府伙伴公平起见，我们的股东应该承认(实际上应该大肆宣扬)，伯克希尔的繁荣是因为公司在美国经营。自1965年以来，如果没有伯克希尔公司，我们的国家也会取得辉煌的成就。然而，如果没有美国，伯克希尔公司将永远无法成为今天的样子。当你看到国旗时，请说一句感谢。

- From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in insurance “float” – money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively small sum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the insurance business to $147 billion. 
  
  自1967年以860万美元收购国民保险公司(National Indemnity)开始，伯克希尔公司已经成为世界保险业界"浮存金"规模最大的公司之一。"浮存金"是我们持有并可以用它们投资，但不属于我们的资金。包括来自人寿保险的，相对较小的金额在内，伯克希尔的浮存金规模已经从我们进入保险业时的1900万美元增长到1470亿美元。到目前为止，这笔浮存金对我们来说持有成本近乎为零。 
  
  So far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurance losses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year profit from the underwriting activities that generated our float. 
  
  尽管我们经历了几年的保险承保损失加上运营费用超过保费的情况，但总体而言，在55年的时间里，我们从产生浮存金的保险业务中获得了适度的承保盈利。 
  
  Of equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily, but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we can therefore think long-term. 
  
  同样重要的是，浮存金是非常有粘性的。我们保险业务的资金每天都在来来去去，但总额不会急剧下降。因此当涉及到浮存金投资时，我们可以做长期考虑。 
  
  If you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. To my surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire owners though is _not_ reflected in our GAAP (“generally-accepted accounting principles”) presentation of earnings and net worth. 
  
  如果你还不熟悉浮存金的概念，我建议你看看A-5页的长篇解释。令我惊讶的是，我们的浮存金去年增加了90亿美元，这种价值的积累对伯克希尔的股东来说是非常重要的。虽然它没有反映在我们的GAAP(公认会计原则)的收益和净值报告中。
  
  Much of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire’s good luck in my 1986 hiring of Ajit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience had been. He replied, “None.” 
  
  我们在保险业创造的巨大价值，很大程度上归功于伯克希尔在1986年雇用阿吉特·贾恩(Ajit Jain)时候的好运气。我们第一次见面是在一个周六的早上，我很快问了阿吉特他的保险经验是什么？他回答说："没有"。 
  
  I said, “Nobody’s perfect,” and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice as could have been made. Better yet, he continues to be – 35 years later. 
  
  我说，"人无完人"。然后雇用了他。那是我的幸运日：阿吉特实际上是一个完美的选择。更妙的是，他在35年后依然如此。 
  
  One final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely – but far from assured – that Berkshire’s float can be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain, however, that there will be some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums. 
  
  我关于保险的最后一个想法是：我认为，伯克希尔的浮存金规模，未来很有可能(但远不能保证)保持下去，并且不发生长期承保损失。然而，我可以肯定的是，在某些年份，我们会经历承保损失，也许金额会很大。 
  
  Berkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer – and that priority will remain long after Charlie and I are gone. 
  
  伯克希尔处理灾难性事件的能力是其他保险公司所不能比拟的，而且在查理和我离开很长一段时间以后，这一优势仍将长期存在。 

# Our Four Giants 我们的四巨头

Through Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have a collection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations, ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices. 

通过伯克希尔，我们的股东拥有几十家企业。其中一些企业又有自己的子公司。例如，Marmon集团有100多个独立的子公司，涵盖从铁路车辆的租赁到医疗设备的制造。

- Nevertheless, operations of our “Big Four” companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire’s value. Leading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massive float value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinary amount of capital we invest to back up their promises. 
  
  尽管如此，我们"四大"业务的运营在伯克希尔的价值中占了很大的比重。领头的是我们的保险业务群。伯克希尔拥有这个集团的100%股权，我们已在前面描述过该集团浮存金的巨大价值。因我们为支持其保单承诺而投入其中的巨额资本金，这些保险公司的投资资产又进一步扩大了。 
  
  The insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volume will generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will forever be important. Our company can and _will_ behave well. 
  
  保险业务是为伯克希尔量身定做的。保险产品永远不会过时，保费收入通常会随着经济增长和通货膨胀而增加。此外，诚信和资本将永远重要。我们公司能够而且一定会经营得很好。
  
  There are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’s operation, however, would be almost impossible. 
  
  当然，还有其他一些保险公司拥有出色的商业模式和前景。然而，要复制伯克希尔的经营模式几乎是不可能的。

- Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here, our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. But consider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million. We spent no Berkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job. 
  
  按年底市值衡量，苹果公司是我们的第二大巨头，这是我们另一种类型的持仓。在这里，我们的持股比例仅为5.55%，高于一年前的5.39%。这个增幅听起来像是小菜一碟。但考虑到苹果2021年的收益中，每0.1%的持股都是1亿美元。我们并没有花费伯克希尔的资金进行增持，是苹果的回购起了作用。 
  
  It’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amounted to a staggering $5.6 billion. Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well. 
  
  最重要的是要知道，在伯克希尔报告的GAAP收益中，只有苹果的股息被计算在内。去年，苹果支付了我们7.85亿美元的股息。然而，按持股比例我们在苹果公司利润中应占份额达到了惊人的56亿美元，公司保留大部分利润用来回购苹果公司的股票，我们对这种行为表示赞赏。苹果公司才华横溢的CEO蒂姆库克(Tim Cook)将苹果产品的用户视为自己的初恋，他所有的其他支持者也受益于蒂姆的管理才能。
  
- BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries were instead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar. 
  
  BNSF铁路是我们的第三大巨头，它依然是美国商业的第一大动脉，这使它成为美国和伯克希尔不可或缺的资产。如果BNSF运输的许多重要产品改用卡车运输，那么美国的碳排放量将井喷。 
  
  Your railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the old-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated after interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” to earnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks have risen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..) 
  
  BNSF在2021年的收益达到了创纪录的60亿美元。这里需要指出的是，我们谈论的是我们喜欢的老式收益：扣除利息、税收、折旧、摊销和所有形式计提后的计算的数字。(我们的"老式收益"也提出了一个警告。随着股票的上涨，对收益的欺骗性"调整"(说的客气一点)，变得更加频繁和更加虚幻。说得不那么客气，我想说的是，牛市越来越像"吹牛"了……)。 
  
  BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments far exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad. 
  
  BNSF的火车去年行驶了1.43亿英里，运送了5.35亿吨货物。这两项成就都远远超过了其他任何美国承运人。你可以为你拥有的铁路感到骄傲。

- BHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of the company. 
  
  我们最后的巨人是伯克希尔能源公司(BHE)，它在2021年创造了创纪录的40亿美元收益。相比2000年伯克希尔首次收购其股份时的1.22亿美元，收益增长了30多倍。现在，伯克希尔拥有该公司91.1%的股份。 
  
  BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had no wind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant in the huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE has become a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmission throughout much of the United States. 
  
  BHE的社会成就与其财务业绩一样引人注目。该公司在2000年没有风能和太阳能发电。当时，它只是被认为是美国庞大的电力事业行业中一个相对较新的小型参与者。随后，在大卫索科尔和格雷格阿贝尔的领导下，BHE成为了一家公用事业电力公司(请不要抱怨)，以及美国风能、太阳能和输电领域的领军企业。 
  
  Greg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is not in any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing its plans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since 2007. 
  
  格雷格关于这些成就的报告出现在A3-A4页。你会发现那里的介绍绝对不是时下流行的"洗绿"故事( 指企业伪装成环境之友，试图掩盖对社会和环境的破坏，以此保全和扩大自己的市场或影响力)。早在2007年开始，BHE每年都会详细介绍其在可再生能源和输电方面的计划和业绩。 
  
  To further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that the company has long been making climate-conscious moves that soak up all of its earnings. More opportunities lie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projects that our country needs. 
  
  想进一步了解这些信息，请访问BHE的网站brkenergy.com在那里，你会看到该公司长期以来一直在实施应对气候变化的举措，这些举措消耗了其所有的利润。但前方有更多的机会。BHE拥有良好的管理、经验、资本，可以满足国家对大型电力项目的需求。 

# Investments 投资业务

Now let’s talk about companies we don’t control, a list that again references Apple. Below we list our fifteen largest equity holdings, several of which are selections of Berkshire’s two long-time investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. At yearend, this valued pair had total authority in respect to $34 billion of investments, many of which do not meet the threshold value we use in the table. Also, a significant portion of the dollars that Todd and Ted manage are lodged in various pension plans of Berkshire-owned businesses, with the assets of these plans not included in this table. 

现在让我们来谈谈我们非控股的公司，这个列表再次提到了苹果。下面表格列出了我们持仓市值最大的15只股票，其中几只是伯克希尔的两位长期投资经理托德库姆斯(Todd Combs)和特德韦施勒(Ted Weschler)精选的。到2021年底，这对明星投资经理对340亿美元的投资组合拥有完全的权力，其中许多投资都没有达到我们表中披露的门槛。此外，托德和特德管理的相当大一部分资金放在伯克希尔旗下企业的各种养老金计划中，这些计划的资产未包含在此表中。

\* This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis.

\* 成本是我们的实际买入价，也是我们的计税基础；

\*\* Held by BHE; consequently, Berkshire shareholders have only a 91.1% interest in this position. 

\*\* BYD由BHE持有，因此伯克希尔股东仅持有其91.1%的权益； 

\*\*\* Includes a $10 billion investment in Occidental Petroleum, consisting of preferred stock and warrants to buy common stock, a combination now being valued at $10.7 billion. 

\*\*\* 其他项包括对西方石油公司OXY的100亿美元投资，包括优先股和购买普通股的认股权证，这一组合现在价值107亿美元。 

In addition to the footnoted Occidental holding and our various common-stock positions, Berkshire also owns a 26.6% interest in Kraft Heinz (accounted for on the “equity” method, not market value, and carried at $13.1 billion) and 38.6% of Pilot Corp., a leader in travel centers that had revenues last year of $45 billion. 

除了脚注位置的西方石油和各种普通股头寸外，伯克希尔还拥有卡夫亨氏(Kraft Heinz)26.6%的权益(按权益法而非市值核算，其价值为131亿美元)和Pilot公司38.6%的权益。Pilot公司是旅行连锁的龙头企业，去年的收入为450亿美元。 

Since we purchased our Pilot stake in 2017, this holding has warranted “equity” accounting treatment. Early in 2023, Berkshire will purchase an additional interest in Pilot that will raise our ownership to 80% and lead to our fully consolidating Pilot’s earnings, assets and liabilities in our financial statements. 

自从我们在2017年购买了Pilot 股份以来，这部分股份已进行了权益法会计处理。在2023年初，伯克希尔将购买Pilot的额外权益，这将使我们的所有权提高到80%，并要求我们在财务报表中完全合并Pilot的收益、资产和负债。

# U.S. Treasury Bills 美国国债

Berkshire’s balance sheet includes $144 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding the holdings of BNSF and BHE). Of this sum, $120 billion is held in U.S. Treasury bills, all maturing in less than a year. That stake leaves Berkshire financing about 1⁄2 of 1% of the publicly-held national debt. 

伯克希尔的资产负债表包括1440亿美元的现金和现金等价物(不包括持有的BNSF和BHE)。其中，1200亿美元以美国国债的形式持有，全部在一年之内到期。这使得公开市场持有的国债大约0.5%的资金来自伯克希尔。 

Charlie and I have pledged that Berkshire (along with our subsidiaries other than BNSF and BHE) will always hold more than $30 billion of cash and equivalents. We want your company to be financially impregnable and never dependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends). Both of us like to sleep soundly, and we want our creditors, insurance claimants and you to do so as well. 

查理和我已承诺，伯克希尔(以及除BNSF和BHE外的子公司)将始终持有超过300亿美元的现金和等价物。我们希望贵公司在财务上坚不可摧，从不依赖陌生人(甚至朋友)的善意。我们希望夜夜安枕，希望我们的债权人、保险投保人和股东们也是如此。 

But $144 billion? 

但1440亿美元，会不会太多了？ 

That imposing sum, I assure you, is not some deranged expression of patriotism. Nor have Charlie and I lost our overwhelming preference for business ownership. Indeed, I first manifested my enthusiasm for that 80 years ago, on March 11, 1942, when I purchased three shares of Cities Services preferred stock. Their cost was $114.75 and required all of my savings. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average that day closed at 99, a fact that should scream to you: Never bet against America.) 

我向你保证，这笔巨款并不是爱国主义的疯狂表现。查理和我也没有失去对拥有企业所有权的压倒性偏好。事实上，80年前的1942年3月11日，当我购买了3股Cities Services优先股时，我第一次表现出对拥有企业的热情。它们的成本是114.75美元，花费了我所有的积蓄。(当天道琼斯工业平均指数收于99点，这一事实告诉我们：永远不要做空美国。) 

After my initial plunge, I always kept at least 80% of my net worth in equities. My favored status throughout that period was 100% – and still is. Berkshire’s current 80%-or-so position in businesses is a consequence of my failure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long- term holding. 

在我第一次遭受暴跌之后，我总是将至少80%的净资产投资在股票上。在那段时间里，我最青睐的状态是100%，现在仍然如此。伯克希尔目前的80%的仓位是因为，我还没有找到符合我们长期持有标准的整个公司或其中一小部分流通股。 

Charlie and I have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past. These periods are never pleasant; they are also never permanent. And, fortunately, we have had a mildly attractive alternative during 2020 and 2021 for deploying capital. Read on. 

查理和我在过去不时遭遇类似的现金仓位很大的状况。这些时期从来不是令人愉快的，也不是永久性的。幸运的是，在2020年和2021年，我们找到一个温和的、有吸引力的替代现金的方案。请继续阅读。

# Share Repurchases 股份回购

There are three ways that we can increase the value of your investment. The first is always front and center in our minds: Increase the long-term earning power of Berkshire’s controlled businesses through internal growth or by making acquisitions. Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of those opportunities, however, is small compared to Berkshire’s resources. 

我们可以通过三种方式增加您的投资价值。第一种方式始终是我们心目中的重中之重：通过内部增长或收购来提高伯克希尔控股公司的长期盈利能力。如今内部增长带来的回报远高于外部收购。然而，与伯克希尔的资源相比，这些内部机会的规模都很小。

Our second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that are publicly traded. From time to time, such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive. Today, though, we find little that excites us. 

我们的第二个选择是：购买许多公开交易的优秀及伟大企业的部分非控股权益。有时，这样的可能性既多又极具吸引力。然而如今，我们几乎没有发现什么能让我们兴奋的东西。 

That’s largely because of a truism: Long-term interest rates that are low push the prices of all productive investments upward, whether these are stocks, apartments, farms, oil wells, whatever. Other factors influence valuations as well, but interest rates will always be important. 

这主要是因为一个不争的事实：长期的低利率推动了所有生产性资产的价格上升。无论是股票、地产、农场、油井等等。其他因素也会影响估值，但利率始终是很重要的。 

Our final path to value creation is to repurchase Berkshire shares. Through that simple act, we increase your share of the many controlled and non-controlled businesses Berkshire owns. When the price/value equation is right, this path is the easiest and most certain way for us to increase your wealth. (Alongside the accretion of value to continuing shareholders, a couple of other parties gain: Repurchases are modestly beneficial to the seller of the repurchased shares and to society as well.) 

我们创造价值的最后一条途径是：回购伯克希尔的股票。通过这个简单的举动，我们增加了您在伯克希尔拥有的众多控股和非控股企业中的份额。当价格/价值很划算时，回购是我们增加您财富的最简单和最确定的方式。(除了继续持有的股东其持股价值将增加外，其他几方也有获益。回购对被回购股份的卖方和社会都有一定的好处。) 

Periodically, as alternative paths become unattractive, repurchases make good sense for Berkshire’s owners. During the past two years, we therefore repurchased 9% of the shares that were outstanding at yearend 2019 for a total cost of $51.7 billion. That expenditure left our continuing shareholders owning about 10% more of all Berkshire businesses, whether these are wholly-owned (such as BNSF and GEICO) or partly-owned (such as Coca-Cola and Moody’s). 

定期地，随着替代方式越来越没有吸引力，回购对伯克希尔的股东来说变得很有意义。因此，在过去两年中，我们回购了截止2019年末外部流通股的9%，总成本517亿美元。这笔支出使我们的长期股东拥有伯克希尔所有业务能够多出约10%，无论这些业务是全资拥有(如BNSF和GEICO)还是部分拥有(如可口可乐和穆迪)。 

I want to underscore that for Berkshire repurchases to make sense, our shares must offer appropriate value. We don’t want to overpay for the shares of other companies, and it would be value-destroying if we were to overpay when we are buying Berkshire. As of February 23, 2022, since yearend we repurchased additional shares at a cost of $1.2 billion. Our appetite remains large but will always remain price-dependent. 

我想强调的是，要使伯克希尔公司的股票回购有意义，我们的股票必须价格合理。我们不想为其他公司的股票多付钱，如果我们在回购伯克希尔股票时支付过高的价格，那也得不偿失。从去年年底到2022年2月23日以来，我们以12亿美元的成本回购了更多股票。我们的胃口仍然很大，但将始终取决于价格。

It should be noted that Berkshire’s buyback opportunities are limited because of its high-class investor base. If our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators, both price volatility and transaction volumes would materially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by making repurchases. Nevertheless, Charlie and I far prefer the owners we have, even though their admirable buy-and-keep attitudes limit the extent to which long-term shareholders can profit from opportunistic repurchases. 

应该指出的是，伯克希尔股票的回购机会是有限的，因为它拥有一流的投资者基础。如果我们的股票被短期投机者大量持有，其价格波动和交易量都会大幅放大，这可能为我们提供更多通过回购为长期股东创造价值的机会。尽管如此，查理和我更喜欢我们拥有的股东，尽管他们令人钦佩的买入并持有的态度，限制了长期股东从机会性回购中获利的规模。 

Finally, one easily-overlooked value calculation specific to Berkshire: As we’ve discussed, insurance “float” of the right sort is of great value to us. As it happens, repurchases automatically increase the amount of “float” per share. That figure has increased during the past two years by 25% – going from $79,387 per “A” share to $99,497, a meaningful gain that, as noted, owes some thanks to repurchases. 

最后，伯克希尔公司特有的一个很容易被忽视的价值计算：正如我们所讨论的，低成本类型的保险"浮存金"对我们来说很有价值。碰巧的是，回购会自动增加每股"浮存金"的金额。这一数字在过去两年中增长了25%，从每股"A"类股79387美元增至99497美元，如前所述，这在一定程度上归功于回购。

# A Wonderful Man and a Wonderful Business 一个了不起的男人和一个了不起的生意

Last year, Paul Andrews died. Paul was the founder and CEO of TTI, a Fort Worth-based subsidiary of Berkshire. Throughout his life – in both his business and his personal pursuits – Paul quietly displayed all the qualities that Charlie and I admire. His story should be told. 

去年，保罗·安德鲁斯(Paul Andrews)去世。Paul是伯克希尔位于沃斯堡的子公司TTI的创始人兼CEO。在他的一生中，无论是在他的事业中还是在他的个人追求中，Paul都默默地展示了查理和我所钦佩的所有品质。他的故事应该被宣讲。

In 1971, Paul was working as a purchasing agent for General Dynamics when the roof fell in. After losing a huge defense contract, the company fired thousands of employees, including Paul. 

1971年，Paul在通用动力公司担任采购员时，遭遇了飞来横祸。在失去一份巨大的国防合同后(F-111喷气式战斗机/轰炸机项目停飞)，公司解雇了数千名员工，包括Paul。 

With his first child due soon, Paul decided to bet on himself, using $500 of his savings to found Tex-Tronics (later renamed TTI). The company set itself up to distribute small electronic components, and first-year sales totaled $112,000. Today, TTI markets more than one million different items with annual volume of $7.7 billion. 

由于他的第一个孩子即将出生，Paul决定赌一把，用他的500美元积蓄创建了Tex-Tronics(后来改名为TTI)。该公司分销小型电子元件，第一年的销售总额为11.2万美元。今天，TTI销售超过100万种不同的产品，年销售额达77亿美元。 

But back to 2006: Paul, at 63, then found himself happy with his family, his job, and his associates. But he had one nagging worry, heightened because he had recently witnessed a friend’s early death and the disastrous results that followed for that man’s family and business. What, Paul asked himself in 2006, would happen to the many people depending on him if he should unexpectedly die? 

但回到2006年：时年63岁的Paul发现自己对家人、工作和同事都很满意。但他有一个挥之不去的担忧，因为他刚刚目睹了一位朋友的早逝，以及随之而来的对其家庭和企业的灾难性后果。Paul在2006年问自己，如果他意外死去，许多依赖他的人会发生什么？ 

For a year, Paul wrestled with his options. Sell to a competitor? From a strictly economic viewpoint, that course made the most sense. After all, competitors could envision lucrative “synergies” – savings that would be achieved as the acquiror slashed duplicated functions at TTI. 

整整一年，Paul一直在为自己的选择而苦苦挣扎。把公司卖给竞争对手？从严格的经济角度来看，这种选择是最有意义的。毕竟竞争对手可以预见到有利可图的"协同效应"，当收购方关闭TTI的重复业务部门时，就可以节省成本。

But . . . Such a purchaser would most certainly also retain its CFO, its legal counsel, its HR unit. Their TTI counterparts would therefore be sent packing. And ugh! If a new distribution center were to be needed, the acquirer’s home city would certainly be favored over Fort Worth. 

但收购方肯定会保留其财务总监、法律顾问、人力资源部门。而TTI公司的同一职能部门将被集体裁员。还有，如果需要一个新的配送中心，收购方的家乡肯定会比沃思堡更受青睐。 

Whatever the financial benefits, Paul quickly concluded that selling to a competitor was not for him. He next considered seeking a financial buyer, a species once labeled – aptly so – a leveraged buyout firm. Paul knew, however, that such a purchaser would be focused on an “exit strategy.” And who could know what that would be? Brooding over it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller. 

无论经济利益如何，Paul很快就得出结论，把公司卖给竞争对手不适合他。他接下来考虑寻找一个金融买家，一个曾经被称为杠杆收购公司的物种。然而Paul知道，这样的买家将专注于"退出战略"。谁知道那会是什么呢？考虑到这一切，Paul发现自己没有兴趣把自己35年苦心经营的成果交给一个金融中间商。 

When Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers. He then summed up his dilemma by saying – in far more tactful phrasing than this – “After a year of pondering the alternatives, I want to sell to Berkshire because you are the only guy left.” So, I made an offer and Paul said “Yes.” One meeting; one lunch; one deal. 

当Paul见到我时，他解释了为什么他把这两个备选买家排除在外。然后，他用比这更委婉的措辞总结了他的困境："在思考了一年的替代方案后，我想卖给伯克希尔，因为你是唯一剩下的人。"所以我提出了报价，Paul答应了。一次会面，一顿午餐，达成了一笔交易。 

To say we both lived happily ever after is an understatement. When Berkshire purchased TTI, the company employed 2,387. Now the number is 8,043. A large percentage of that growth took place in Fort Worth and environs. Earnings have increased 673%. 

说我们从此过上了幸福的生活，这样说都不足以表达。当伯克希尔收购TTI时，该公司有2387名员工，现在这个数字是8043，其中很大一部分增长发生在沃斯堡及其周边地区。公司的盈利增长了673%。 

Annually, I would call Paul and tell him his salary should be substantially increased. Annually, he would tell me, “We can talk about that next year, Warren; I’m too busy now.” 

每年我都会给Paul打电话，告诉他的薪水应该大幅增加。但每年他都会告诉我，"我们可以明年再谈，沃伦，我现在太忙了。" 

When Greg Abel and I attended Paul’s memorial service, we met children, grandchildren, long-time associates (including TTI’s first employee) and John Roach, the former CEO of a Fort Worth company Berkshire had purchased in 2000. John had steered his friend Paul to Omaha, instinctively knowing we would be a match. 

当格雷格阿贝尔和我参加Paul的追悼会时，我们见到了他的子女、孙辈、长期合作伙伴(包括TTI的首位员工)，以及约翰·罗奇(John Roach)，他是伯克希尔在2000年收购的沃斯堡Justin工业公司的前CEO。正是John把他的朋友Paul引到了奥马哈，他本能地知道我们会是绝配。 

At the service, Greg and I heard about the multitudes of people and organizations that Paul had silently supported. The breadth of his generosity was extraordinary – geared always to improving the lives of others, particularly those in Fort Worth. 

在追悼会上，格雷格和我听说了很多Paul默默支持的人和组织。他的慷慨是非凡的，他总是致力于改善他人的生活，尤其是沃斯堡的人 

In all ways, Paul was a class act. 

在所有方面Paul都是个杰出的人。

---

Good luck – occasionally extraordinary luck – has played its part at Berkshire. If Paul and I had not enjoyed a mutual friend – John Roach – TTI would not have found its home with us. But that ample serving of luck was only the beginning. TTI was soon to lead Berkshire to its most important acquisition. 

运气——偶尔是非凡的运气——在伯克希尔发挥了作用。如果Paul和我没有共同的朋友John Roach，TTI也不会在我们这里安家。但这份丰盛的幸运大餐仅仅是个开始。TTI很快就将伯克希尔引向了其最重要的收购。

Every fall, Berkshire directors gather for a presentation by a few of our executives. We sometimes choose the site based upon the location of a recent acquisition, by that means allowing directors to meet the new subsidiary’s CEO and learn more about the acquiree’s activities. 

每年秋天，伯克希尔的董事们都会聚集在一起，听取几位高管的陈述。我们有时会根据近期收购的地点来选择会议地点，这意味着董事们可以与新子公司的CEO见面，并更多地了解被收购方的活动。

In the fall of 2009, we consequently selected Fort Worth so that we could visit TTI. At that time, BNSF, which also had Fort Worth as its hometown, was the third-largest holding among our marketable equities. Despite that large stake, I had never visited the railroad’s headquarters. 

在2009年秋天，我们选择了沃斯堡，这样我们就可以访问TTI。当时，总部同样位于沃思堡的BNSF是我们持有股份第三多的公司。尽管有这么多的股份，我却从来没有去考察过这家铁路公司的总部。 

Deb Bosanek, my assistant, scheduled our board’s opening dinner for October 22. Meanwhile, I arranged to arrive earlier that day to meet with Matt Rose, CEO of BNSF, whose accomplishments I had long admired. When I made the date, I had no idea that our get-together would coincide with BNSF’s third-quarter earnings report, which was released late on the 22nd. 

我的助理黛布·博萨内克(Deb Bosanek)将董事会的开幕晚宴安排在10月22日。与此同时，那天我安排早一点到达，为了去见马特·罗斯(Matt Rose)，他是BNSF的CEO，我一直钦佩他的成就。当我确定这个日期的时候，我并不知道我们的聚会将与BNSF在22日晚些时候发布第三季度盈利报告同时举行。 

The market reacted badly to the railroad’s results. The Great Recession was in full force in the third quarter, and BNSF’s earnings reflected that slump. The economic outlook was also bleak, and Wall Street wasn’t feeling friendly to railroads – or much else. 

市场对这家铁路公司的业绩反应不佳。"大衰退"在那年第三季度全面爆发，BNSF的盈利情况反映了这种衰退。经济前景也很黯淡，华尔街对铁路或其他很多东西也不友好。 

On the following day, I again got together with Matt and suggested that Berkshire would offer the railroad a better long-term home than it could expect as a public company. I also told him the maximum price that Berkshire would pay. 

第二天，我再次与马特会面，并建议伯克希尔将为铁路公司提供一个比作为上市公司所能期望的更好的长期归宿。我还告诉他伯克希尔愿意支付的最高价格。

Matt relayed the offer to his directors and advisors. Eleven busy days later, Berkshire and BNSF announced a firm deal. And here I’ll venture a rare prediction: BNSF will be a key asset for Berkshire and our country a century from now. 

马特将这一提议转达给了他的董事和顾问。经过忙碌的11天后，伯克希尔和BNSF宣布了一项确定交易。 在这里，我要做一个罕见的预测：未来一个世纪BNSF将成为伯克希尔哈撒韦公司和我们国家的核心资产。

The BNSF acquisition would never have happened if Paul Andrews hadn’t sized up Berkshire as the right home for TTI. 

如果保罗没有将伯克希尔视为TTI的合适归宿，BNSF的收购就永远不会发生。

# Thanks 致谢

I taught my first investing class 70 years ago. Since then, I have enjoyed working almost every year with students of all ages, finally “retiring” from that pursuit in 2018. 

70年前，我教授了我的第一堂投资课。从那以后，我几乎每年都很享受与各个年龄段的学生一起工作，最终在2018年我从这个追求中"退休"。 

Along the way, my toughest audience was my grandson’s fifth-grade class. The 11-year-olds were squirming in their seats and giving me blank stares until I mentioned Coca-Cola and its famous secret formula. Instantly, every hand went up, and I learned that “secrets” are catnip to kids. 

一直以来，我最难对付的听众是我孙子所在的五年级班级。11岁的孩子们在座位上扭来扭去，茫然地看着我，直到我提到可口可乐及其著名的秘密配方时，瞬间每个人都举起手来，我明白了"秘密"对孩子们来说是一种诱惑。 

Teaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenon the orangutan effect: If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, you may leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly. 

教学，就像写作一样，帮助我发展和理清了自己的思路。查理称这种现象为猩猩效应：如果你和一只猩猩坐在一起，仔细地向它解释你一个珍视的想法，你可能会留下一只迷惑不解的灵长类动物，但你自己的思维会更清晰。

Talking to university students is far superior. I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2) with the kind of people they would select, if they had no need for money. Economic realities, I acknowledge, may interfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sort of job, they will no longer be “working.” 

和大学生交谈则要有效得多。我敦促他们：在自己喜欢的领域找工作；如果不急需钱的话，选择自己喜欢的人一起工作。我承认，经济现实可能会干扰这种寻找。即便如此，我敦促学生们永远不要放弃追求，因为当他们找到那种热爱的工作时，他们就不再是"工作"了。

Charlie and I, ourselves, followed that liberating course after a few early stumbles. We both started as part- timers at my grandfather’s grocery store, Charlie in 1940 and I in 1942. We were each assigned boring tasks and paid little, definitely not what we had in mind. Charlie later took up law, and I tried selling securities. Job satisfaction continued to elude us. 

查理和我自己在经历了一些早期的挫折后，走上了这条自由的道路。我们都是在我祖父的杂货店里做兼职，查理1940年，我1942年。我们每个人都被安排了无聊的任务，报酬也很少，这绝对不是我们想要的。后来，查理开始从事法律工作，而我则尝试着销售证券。但我们仍然不能从工作上获得多少满足感。

Finally, at Berkshire, we found what we love to do. With very few exceptions, we have now “worked” for many decades with people whom we like and trust. It’s a joy in life to join with managers such as Paul Andrews or the Berkshire families I told you about last year. In our home office, we employ decent and talented people – no jerks. Turnover averages, perhaps, one person per year. 

最后，在伯克希尔，我们找到了自己喜欢做的事情。除了极少数例外，我们现在已经与我们喜欢和信任的人共事了几十年。与保罗·安德鲁斯或我去年告诉过你的伯克希尔大家庭这样的经理人共事，是人生的一大乐事。在我们的总部，我们雇佣正派和有才华的人，没有一个混蛋。每年的平均流动率大概只有一个人。 

I would like, however, to emphasize a further item that turns our jobs into fun and satisfaction - - - - working for you. There is nothing more rewarding to Charlie and me than enjoying the trust of individual long-term shareholders who, for many decades, have joined us with the expectation that we would be a reliable custodian of their funds. 

然而，我想强调另一件事，为股东工作使我们的工作变得有趣和满足。对查理和我来说，没有什么比获得长期个人股东的信任更值得的了。几十年来，他们加入我们，期望我们成为他们资金最可靠的托管人。

Obviously, we can’t select our owners, as we could do if our form of operation were a partnership. Anyone can buy shares of Berkshire today with the intention of soon reselling them. For sure, we get a few of that type of shareholder, just as we get index funds that own huge amounts of Berkshire simply because they are required to do so. 

显然，我们无法选择我们的股东，如果我们的经营形式是合伙制的话，我们可以这样做。今天任何人都可以购买伯克希尔的股票，并打算很快再出售这些股票。当然，我们会有一些这样的一些股东，就像我们会有指数基金持有大量伯克希尔股票，只是因为它们被要求这么做。

To a truly unusual degree, however, Berkshire has as owners a very large corps of individuals and families that have elected to join us with an intent approaching “til death do us part.” Often, they have trusted us with a large – some might say excessive – portion of their savings. 

伯克希尔拥有一个庞大的个人和家族群体，他们选择加入我们，并且"至死不渝"到了一个不同寻常的程度。他们把很大一部分(有些人可能会说太多了)的资金托付给我们。 

Berkshire, these shareholders would sometimes acknowledge, might be far from the best selection they could have made. But they would add that Berkshire would rank high among those with which they would be most comfortable. And people who are comfortable with their investments will, on average, achieve better results than those who are motivated by ever-changing headlines, chatter and promises. 

这些股东有时会承认，伯克希尔可能远不是他们本可以做出的最佳选择。但他们会补充说，在他们最满意的投资对象中，伯克希尔的排名靠前。平均而言，那些对自己的投资感到舒服的人，将比那些被不断变化的头条新闻、传言和承诺所影响的人，获得更好的投资结果。 

Long-term individual owners are both the “partners” Charlie and I have always sought and the ones we constantly have in mind as we make decisions at Berkshire. To them we say, “It feels good to ‘work’ for you, and you have our thanks for your trust.” 

长期的个人股东既是查理和我一直寻求的"合伙人"，也是我们在伯克希尔做决策时一直铭记的"合伙人"。我们想对他们说："为你'工作'感觉很好，我们感谢你的信任。"

# The Annual Meeting 年度股东大会

Clear your calendar! Berkshire will have its annual gathering of capitalists in Omaha on Friday, April 29th through Sunday, May 1st. The details regarding the weekend are laid out on pages A-1 and A-2. Omaha eagerly awaits you, as do I.

I will end this letter with a sales pitch. “Cousin” Jimmy Buffett has designed a pontoon “party” boat that is now being manufactured by Forest River, a Berkshire subsidiary. The boat will be introduced on April 29 at our Berkshire Bazaar of Bargains. And, for two days only, shareholders will be able to purchase Jimmy’s masterpiece at a 10% discount. Your bargain-hunting chairman will be buying a boat for his family’s use. Join me. 

我要用一个广告来结束这封信。"表弟"吉米·巴菲特设计了一款浮式"派对"游艇，目前由伯克希尔子公司Forest River生产。这款游艇将于4月29日在伯克希尔股东大会上发布。而且，仅在两天时间内，股东可以以10%的折扣购买吉米的杰作。你们的董事长会买一艘供家人使用，加入我吧。
